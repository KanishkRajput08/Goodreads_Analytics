The Last Full Measure,Jeff Shaara,4.24,"17,073 rating","June 1, 1998","Librarian's note: An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found here.In the Pulitzer prize-winning classic The Killer Angels,  Michael Shaara created the finest Civil War novel of our time. In the bestselling Gods and Generals,  Shaara's son, Jeff, brilliantly sustained his father's vision, telling the epic story of the events culminating in the Battle of Gettysburg. Now, Jeff Shaara brings this legendary father-son trilogy to its stunning conclusion in a novel that brings to life the final two years of the Civil War.As The Last Full Measure opens, Gettysburg is past and the war advances to its third brutal year. On the Union side, the gulf between the politicians in Washington and the generals in the field yawns ever wider. Never has the cumbersome Union Army so desperately needed a decisive, hard-nosed leader. It is at this critical moment that Lincoln places Ulysses S. Grant in command--and turns the tide of war.For Robert E. Lee, Gettysburg was an unspeakable disaster--compounded by the shattering loss of the fiery Stonewall Jackson two months before. Lee knows better than anyone that the South cannot survive a war of attrition. But with the total devotion of his generals--Longstreet, Hill, Stuart--and his unswerving faith in God, Lee is determined to fight to the bitter end.Here too is Joshua Chamberlain, the college professor who emerged as the Union hero of Gettysburg--and who will rise to become one of the greatest figures of the Civil War.Battle by staggering battle, Shaara dramatizes the escalating confrontation between Lee and Grant--complicated, heroic, deeply troubled men. From the costly Battle of the Wilderness to the agonizing siege of Petersburg to Lee's epoch-making surrender at Appomattox, Shaara portrays the riveting conclusion of the Civil War through the minds and hearts of the individuals who gave their last full measure.Full of human passion and the spellbinding truth of history, The Last Full Measure is the fitting capstone to a magnificent literary trilogy.From the Hardcover edition.",640,"['Historical Fiction', 'Civil War', 'Fiction', 'War', 'Historical', 'American History', 'Military Fiction']","1,883 follower",480 review,53,136 (<1%),331 (1%),"2,402 (14%)","6,657 (38%)","7,547 (44%)"

Trinta e quatro anos depois de se casar com Jorge Amado, a sempre apaixonada Zélia abandona a posição de coadjuvante no mundo literário e experimenta a própria voz para contar a saga de sua família.É assim que ficamos conhecendo a intrépida aventura dos imigrantes italianos em busca da terra de sonhos, e o percurso interior da pequena Zélia na capital paulista - uma menina para quem a vida, mesmo nos momentos mais adversos ou indecifráveis, nunca perdeu o encanto.

Tales of Moonlight and Rain,Ueda Akinari,3.81,"2,531 rating","January 1, 1776","First published in 1776, the nine gothic tales in this collection are Japan's finest and most celebrated examples of the literature of the occult. They subtly merge the world of reason with the realm of the uncanny and exemplify the period's fascination with the strange and the grotesque. They were also the inspiration for Mizoguchi Kenji's brilliant 1953 film Ugetsu.The title Ugetsu monogatari (literally ""rain-moon tales"") alludes to the belief that mysterious beings appear on cloudy, rainy nights and in mornings with a lingering moon. In ""Shiramine,"" the vengeful ghost of the former emperor Sutoku reassumes the role of king; in ""The Chrysanthemum Vow,"" a faithful revenant fulfills a promise; ""The Kibitsu Cauldron"" tells a tale of spirit possession; and in ""The Carp of My Dreams,"" a man straddles the boundaries between human and animal and between the waking world and the world of dreams. The remaining stories feature demons, fiends, goblins, strange dreams, and other manifestations beyond all logic and common sense.The eerie beauty of this masterpiece owes to Akinari's masterful combination of words and phrases from Japanese classics with creatures from Chinese and Japanese fiction and lore. Along with The Tale of Genji and The Tales of the Heike, Tales of Moonlight and Rain has become a timeless work of great significance.

Boneheads fail, usually by stumbling over their own two feet. Boneheads are reactive. Inept. They cause events to unfold mainly by accident. Bastards screw Canada. Boneheads just screw up.BASTARDS AND BONEHEADS makes an excellent parlour game. Pierre Trudeau was a Bastard. Joe Clark was not. Brian Mulroney managed to be both.

He takes on the full sweep of Canadian history, examining and evaluating the key personalities behind our most momentous events. When the English captured Quebec in 1759, was it a “Battle of Boneheads” or a “Contest of Bastards”? Was the War of 1812 won by Bastards? Or lost by Boneheads?

Whatever Happened to the Human Race?,Francis A. Schaeffer,4.15,275 rating,"January 1, 1979","""If a mother can kill her own children, then what can be next?"" Mother Teresa once asked. What indeed? Once the value of human life has been depreciated, as in Roe v. Wade and the Baby Doe Case, no one is safe. Once ""quality of life"" is substituted for the absolute value of human life itself, we all are endangered. Already respected scientists are calling for a time period following birth (a week or so) to decide if newborns have ""sufficient quality of life"" to be allowed to live. Already committees of ""medical professionals"" would like to decide whether the ""quality of life"" of the elderly or anyone seriously ill is high enough to allow them to go on living. In this moving book, the renowned pediatric surgeon and Surgeon General of the United States, C. Everett Koop, M.D., joins with one of the leading Christian thinkers of our day, Francis A. Schaeffer, to analyze the widespread implications and frightening loss of human rights brought on by today's practices of abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia. They see the present as a crucial turning point. Choices are being made that undermine human rights at their most basic level. Practices once labeled ""unthinkable"" are now considered acceptable. The destruction of human life, young and old, is being sanctioned on an ever-increasing scale by the medical profession, by the courts, by parents, and by silent citizens. ""But what can I do?"" you ask. ""I'm just one person."" You can start by reading this book. Yes, it will shock you. And it will make you weep.

Morison’s stirring intellectual exploration of the historical record proved to be an excellent starting point for my spiritual investigation."" --From the foreword by Lee Strobel English journalist Frank Morison had a tremendous drive to learn of Christ. The strangeness of the Resurrection story had captured his attention, and, influenced by skeptic thinkers at the turn of the century, he set out to prove that the story of Christ’s Resurrection was only a myth. His probings, however, led him to discover the validity of the biblical record in a moving, personal way. Who Moved the Stone? is considered by many to be a classic apologetic on the subject of the Resurrection. Morison includes a vivid and poignant account of Christ’s betrayal, trial, and death as a backdrop to his retelling of the climactic Resurrection itself.

It was simply astonishing how economists the world over put up with this, but it happened. He converted a whole generation in the late period of the Great Depression.

The Price of Glory: Verdun 1916,Alistair Horne,4.29,"2,842 rating","January 1, 1962","
The Price of Glory: Verdun 1916 
is the second book of Alistair Horne's trilogy, which includes The Fall of Paris and To Lose a Battle and tells the story of the great crises of the rivalry between France and Germany.The battle of Verdun lasted ten months. It was a battle in which at least 700,000 men fell, along a front of fifteen miles. Its aim was less to defeat the enemy than bleed him to death and a battleground whose once fertile terrain is even now a haunted wilderness.Alistair Horne's classic work, continuously in print for over fifty years, is a profoundly moving, sympathetic study of the battle and the men who fought there. It shows that Verdun is a key to understanding the First World War to the minds of those who waged it, the traditions that bound them and the world that gave them the opportunity.'Verdun was the bloodiest battle in history ...

When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management,Roger Lowenstein,4.20,"28,892 rating","January 1, 2000","“A riveting account that reaches beyond the market landscape to say something universal about risk and triumph, about hubris and failure.”— The New York TimesNAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY BUSINESSWEEKIn this business classic—now with a new Afterword in which the author draws parallels to the recent financial crisis—Roger Lowenstein captures the gripping roller-coaster ride of Long-Term Capital Management. Drawing on confidential internal memos and interviews with dozens of key players, Lowenstein explains not just how the fund made and lost its money but also how the personalities of Long-Term’s partners, the arrogance of their mathematical certainties, and the culture of Wall Street itself contributed to both their rise and their fall.When it was founded in 1993, Long-Term was hailed as the most impressive hedge fund in history. But after four years in which the firm dazzled Wall Street as a $100 billion moneymaking juggernaut, it suddenly suffered catastrophic losses that jeopardized not only the biggest banks on Wall Street but the stability of the financial system itself. The dramatic story of Long-Term’s fall is now a chilling harbinger of the crisis that would strike all of Wall Street, from Lehman Brothers to AIG, a decade later. In his new Afterword, Lowenstein shows that LTCM’s implosion should be seen not as a one-off drama but as a template for market meltdowns in an age of instability—and as a wake-up call that Wall Street and government alike tragically ignored.Praise for When Genius Failed“[Roger] Lowenstein has written a squalid and fascinating tale of world-class greed and, above all, hubris.” —BusinessWeek“Compelling . . .

"Exclusion and Embrace: A Theological Exploration of Identity, Otherness, and Reconciliation",Miroslav Volf,4.30,"2,403 rating","January 1, 1996","Life at the end of the twentieth century presents us with a disturbing reality. Otherness, the simple fact of being different in some way, has come to be defined as in and of itself evil. Miroslav Volf contends that if the healing word of the gospel is to be heard today, Christian theology must find ways of speaking that address the hatred of the other. Reaching back to the New Testament metaphor of salvation as reconciliation, Volf proposes the idea of embrace as a theological response to the problem of exclusion.Increasingly we see that exclusion has become the primary sin, skewing our perceptions of reality and causing us to react out of fear and anger to all those who are not within our (ever-narrowing) circle. In light of this, Christians must learn that salvation comes, not only as we are reconciled to God, and not only as we ""learn to live with one another,"" but as we take the dangerous and costly step of opening ourselves to the other, of enfolding him or her in the same embrace with which we have been enfolded by God.Is there any hope of embracing our enemies? Of opening the door to reconciliation? Miroslav Volf, a Yale University theologian, has won the 2002 Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion for his book, Exclusion & Embrace: A Theological Exploration of Identity, Otherness, and Reconciliation (Abingdon, 1996). Volf argues that exclusion of people who are alien or different is among the most intractable problems in the world today. He writes, It may not be too much to claim that the future of our world will depend on how we deal with identity and difference. The issue is urgent. The ghettos and battlefields throughout the world in the living rooms, in inner cities, or on the mountain ranges testify indisputably to its importance. A Croatian by birth, Volf takes as a starting point for his analysis the recent civil war and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, but he readily finds other examples of cultural, ethnic, and racial conflict to illustrate his points. And, since September 11, one can scarcely help but plug the new world players into his incisive descriptions of the dynamics of interethnic and international strife.Exclusion happens, Volf argues, wherever impenetrable barriers are set up that prevent a creative encounter with the other. It is easy to assume that exclusion is the problem or practice of barbarians who live over there, but Volf persuades us that exclusion is all too often our practice here as well. Modern western societies, including American society, typically recite their histories as narratives of inclusion, and Volf celebrates the truth in these narratives. But he points out that these narratives conveniently omit certain groups who disturb the integrity of their happy ending plots. Therefore such narratives of inclusion invite long and gruesome counter-narratives of exclusion the brutal histories of slavery and of the decimation of Native American populations come readily to mind, but more current examples could also be found.Most proposed solutions to the problem of exclusion have focused on social arrangements what kind of society ought we to create in order to accommodate individual or communal difference? Volf focuses, rather, on what kind of selves we need to be in order to live in harmony with others. In addressing the topic, Volf stresses the social implications of divine self-giving. The Christian scriptures attest that God does not abandon the godless to their evil, but gives of Godself to bring them into communion. We are called to do likewise whoever our enemies and whoever we may be. The divine mandate to embrace as God has embraced is summarized in Paul’s injunction to the Romans: Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you (Romans 15:7).Susan R. Garrett, Coordinator of the Religion Award, said that the Grawemeyer selection committee praised Volf s book on many counts. These included its profound interpretation of certain pivotal passages of Scripture and its brilliant engagement with contemporary theology, philosophy, critical theory, and feminist theory. Volf s focus is not on social strategies or programs but, rather, on showing us new ways to understand ourselves and our relation to our enemies. He helps us to imagine new possibilities for living against violence, injustice, and deception. Garrett added that, although addressed primarily to Christians, Volf's theological statement opens itself to religious pluralism by upholding the importance of different religious and cultural traditions for the formation of personal and group identity. The call to embrace the other is never a call to remake the other into one s own image. Volf who had just delivered a lecture on the topic of Exclusion and Embrace at a prayer breakfast for the United Nations when the first hijacked plane hit the World Trade Center will present a lecture and receive his award in Louisville during the first week of April, 2002.The annual Religion Award, which includes a cash prize of $200,000, is given jointly by Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary and the University of Louisville to the authors or originators of creative works that contribute significantly to an understanding of the relationship between human beings and the divine, and ways in which this relationship may inspire or empower human beings to attain wholeness, integrity, or meaning, either individually or in community. The Grawemeyer awards given also by the University of Louisville in the fields of musical composition, education, psychology, and world order honor the virtue of accessibility: works chosen for the awards must be comprehensible to thinking persons who are not specialists in the various fields.""",306,"['Theology', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Christianity', 'Christian', 'Faith', 'Philosophy']",293 follower,190 review,63,36 (1%),73 (3%),281 (11%),755 (31%),"1,258 (52%)"

Neither an apology nor a condemnation, Kurt Cobain presents a vivid insider's view of the life and death of a man who galvanized a generation and gave birth to the ""grunge"" revolution with his band Nirvana. Sandford portrays the provocative, small-town rebel with the talent of John Lennon, and then shows him at work on concert stages in Seattle, New York, and London. Readers follow the struggles of Cobain's emotional life—his tumultuous relationships with family and his fellow band members, his drug addiction and sexual appetite, his stormy marriage to Courtney Love, and the birth of his daughter, who, as Cobain wrote in his suicide note, ""reminds me too much of who I used to be."" During his research, Sandford has had access to Cobain's family, his colleagues, his former friends and lovers, and even author William S. Burroughs, whom Cobain considered to be his ""greatest influence."" The result is a graphic account of the life that led to the day in April 1994 when Cobain turned a shotgun on himself and became a martyr to disaffected youth around the world.",408,"['Music', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Mental Illness', 'Rock N Roll', 'Autobiography']",27 follower,67 review,69,76 (5%),160 (12%),412 (31%),355 (26%),312 (23%)

"Prisoner's Dilemma: John von Neumann, Game Theory, and the Puzzle of the Bomb",William Poundstone,3.92,"1,932 rating","January 1, 1992","A masterful work of science writing that’s ""both a fascinating biography of von Neumann, the Hungarian exile whose mathematical theories were building blocks for the A-bomb and the digital computer, and a brilliant social history of game theory and its role in the Cold War and nuclear arms race"" ( San Francisco Chronicle ). Should you watch public television without pledging?...Exceed the posted speed limit?...Hop a subway turnstile without paying? These questions illustrate the so-called ""prisoner's dilemma"", a social puzzle that we all face every day. Though the answers may seem simple, their profound implications make the prisoner's dilemma one of the great unifying concepts of science. Watching players bluff in a poker game inspired John von Neumann—father of the modern computer and one of the sharpest minds of the century—to construct game theory, a mathematical study of conflict and deception. Game theory was readily embraced at the RAND Corporation, the archetypical think tank charged with formulating military strategy for the atomic age, and in 1950 two RAND scientists made a momentous discovery.Called the ""prisoner's dilemma,"" it is a disturbing and mind-bending game where two or more people may betray the common good for individual gain. Introduced shortly after the Soviet Union acquired the atomic bomb, the prisoner's dilemma quickly became a popular allegory of the nuclear arms race. Intellectuals such as von Neumann and Bertrand Russell joined military and political leaders in rallying to the ""preventive war"" movement, which advocated a nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union. Though the Truman administration rejected preventive war the United States entered into an arms race with the Soviets and game theory developed into a controversial tool of public policy—alternately accused of justifying arms races and touted as the only hope of preventing them.Prisoner's Dilemma is the incisive story of a revolutionary idea that has been hailed as a landmark of twentieth-century thought.",294,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'History', 'Economics', 'Mathematics', 'Biography', 'Psychology']",330 follower,150 review,50,14 (<1%),92 (4%),453 (23%),851 (44%),522 (27%)

Time Will Run Back,Henry Hazlitt,3.84,210 rating,"January 1, 1951","Henry Hazlitt (1894–1993) was a well-known journalist who wrote on economic affairs for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and Newsweek, among many. He is perhaps best known as the author of the classic Economics in One Lesson (1946). But Hazlitt was well equipped to be a fiction writer. He was literary editor of The Nation for three years and H.L. Mencken's successor at the American Mercury.Time Will Run Back is an excellent introduction to the problems of economic systems, and can be a great benefit to young people who are curious about the meaning of economic analysis. It is, in fact, suitable for all ages. The Mises Institute is very pleased to sponsor this Kindle edition.The plot line of this splendid novel, first published in 1951 and revised in 1966, explores the economic theories of capitalism and socialism.It begins in a fully socialist society in which the new leader, who finds himself in that position only by accident, begins to rethink the economic basis of the system. He first begins to wonder whether the economy is doing well at all, and how one might know. This sets him on a path to thinking about prices and calculation, and about the very meaning of productivity.Commerce is introduced when the leader decides to allow the trading of rationing tickets; shortly, markets appear ? and everyone seems to be better off as a result.And on it continues. Slowly, piece by piece, he dismantles central planning and replaces it with a market system. All the while, the characters are engaged in a Socratic-style discussion about the implications of money, exchange, ownership, markets, entrepreneurship, and more.",368,"['Economics', 'Fiction', 'Politics', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Adult Fiction', 'Business']",374 follower,23 review,100,6 (2%),14 (6%),56 (26%),66 (31%),68 (32%)
