There’s Pyotr, the matron’s grandson, a nihilist with a grudge who has fallen for the maid; Stepan, the penniless caretaker, who has sacrificed his youth to the care of the estate; Miss Wrigley, a mysterious Englishwoman who has recently been named sole heiress to the fortune; Poggio, an opportunistic and freeloading “artistic” photographer; and, most intriguingly, Naina, the old lady’s granddaughter, a girl so beautiful she could drive any man to do almost anything.As Pelagia bumbles and intuits her way to the heart of a mystery among people with faith only in greed and desire, she must bear in mind the words of Saint Paul: “Beware of dogs–and beware of evil-doers.”",273,414,"1,520 follower","['Mystery', 'Historical Fiction', 'Russia', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Historical Mystery', 'Detective', 'Mystery', 'Historical Fiction', 'Russia', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Historical Mystery', 'Detective', 'Mystery', 'Historical Fiction', 'Russia', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Historical Mystery', 'Detective']",209 review,"1,066 (28%)","1,348 (35%)",883 (23%),326 (8%),157 (4%)
Youth / Heart of Darkness / The End of the Tether,Joseph Conrad,3.93,413 rating,"January 1, 1924","Conrad's aim was by ""the power of the written word, to make you hear, to make you feel . . . before all, to make you see""Heart of Darkness, his exploration of European colonialism in Africa and of elusive human values, embodies more profoundly than almost any other modern fiction the difficulty of 'seeing,' its relativity and shifting compromise. Portraying a young man's first sea-voyage to the East in Youth, an unenlightened maturity in Heart of Darkness, and the blind old age of Captain Whalley in The End of the Tether, the stories in this volume are united in their theme - the 'Ages of Man' - and in their scepticism. Conrad's vision has influenced twentieth-century writers and artists from T. S. Eliot to Jorge Luis Borges and Werner Herzog, and continues to draw critical fire. In his stimulating introduction John Lyon discusses the links between these three stories, the critiques of Chinua Achebe and Edward Said, and the ebb and flow of Conrad's magnificent narrative art.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

The Olympic Games are about to start; some of Bernie's Jewish friends are beginning to realize that they should have left while they could; and Gunther himself has been hired to look into two murders that reach high into the Nazi Party. In The Pale Criminal, it's 1938, and Gunther has been blackmailed into rejoining the police by Heydrich himself. And in A German Requiem, the saddest and most disturbing of the three books, it's 1947 as Gunther stumbles across a nightmare landscape that conceals even more death than he imagines.

Arendt explores the institutions and operations of totalitarian movements, focusing on the two genuine forms of totalitarian government in our time—Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia—which she adroitly recognizes were two sides of the same coin, rather than opposing philosophies of Right and Left. From this vantage point, she discusses the evolution of classes into masses, the role of propaganda in dealing with the nontotalitarian world, the use of terror, and the nature of isolation and loneliness as preconditions for total domination.",527,377,"3,819 follower","['History', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Sociology', 'Political Science', 'Classics']","1,008 review","6,087 (50%)","4,024 (33%)","1,468 (12%)",338 (2%),130 (1%)

This novel is an astonishing wire-walking exhibition of wit, knowledge, and linguistic mastery. Darconville’s Cat is a novel about love and hate. Among other matters, it deals with delicate tensions between Life and Art, the Ideal and the Real, God and Satan, and, above all, with the crises and conflicts between Man and Woman, the tragic implications of which reach all the way back to the Primal Fall. Its chapters embody a multiplicity of narrative forms, including a diary, a formal oration, an abecedarium, a sermon, a litany, a blank-verse play, poems, essays, parodies, and fables. It is an explosion of vocabulary, rich with comic invention and dark with infernal imagination. Alexander Theroux restores words to life, invents others, liberates a language too long polluted by mutters and mumbles, anti-logic, and the inexact lunacies of the modern world where the possibility of communication itself is in question.

Autumn in Peking,Boris Vian,3.92,"2,845 rating","January 1, 1947","Boris Vian was a jack of all trades - although unfortunately his name was Boris and ""Boris of all trades"" never took off as a turn of phrase. But nevertheless Vian was a great songwriter, playwright, singer, jazz critic and, of course novelist so it should have been Boris instead of Jack. Vian's 1947 novel Autumn in Peking (L'Automne a Pekin) is perhaps Vian's most slapstick work, with an added amount of despair in its exotic recipe for a violent cocktail drink. The story takes place in the imaginary desert called Exopotamie where all the leading characters take part in the building of a train station with tracks that go nowhere. Houses and buildings are destroyed to build this unnecessary structure - and in Vian's world waste not, make not. In Alistair Rolls' pioneering study of Vian's novels, ""The Flight of the Angels,"" he expresses that Exopotamie is a thinly disguised version of Paris, where after the war the city started changing its previous centuries of architecture to something more modern. Yes, something dull to take the place of what was exciting and mysterious. Vian, in a mixture of great humor and unequal amount of disgust, introduces various 'eccentric' characters in this 'desert' adventure, such as Anne and Angel who are best friends; and Rochelle who is in love and sleeps with Anne, while Angel is madly in love with her. Besides the trio there is also Doctor Mangemanche; the archeologist Athanagore Porphyroginite, his aide, Cuivre; and Pipo - all of them in a locality similar to Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, where there is a tinge of darkness and anything is possible, except for happiness.",284,327,"1,634 follower","['Fiction', 'France', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'French Literature', '20th Century', 'Literature', 'Fiction', 'France', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'French Literature', '20th Century', 'Literature', 'Fiction', 'France', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'French Literature', '20th Century', 'Literature', 'Fiction', 'France', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'French Literature', '20th Century', 'Literature', 'Fiction', 'France', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'French Literature', '20th Century', 'Literature']",140 review,944 (33%),"1,018 (35%)",648 (22%),188 (6%),47 (1%)

Spanning the years from the beginning of the century, with its political instability and terrorist threats, to the end of the First World War in 1918, Pedigree is an epic of everyday existence in all its messy unfinished intensity and density, a story about the coming-of-age of a precocious and curiousboy and the coming to be of the modern world.",560,"2,368","1,870 follower","['Fiction', 'Belgium', 'France', 'Mystery', '20th Century', 'Noir', 'War', 'Fiction', 'Belgium', 'France', 'Mystery', '20th Century', 'Noir', 'War', 'Fiction', 'Belgium', 'France', 'Mystery', '20th Century', 'Noir', 'War', 'Fiction', 'Belgium', 'France', 'Mystery', '20th Century', 'Noir', 'War', 'Fiction', 'Belgium', 'France', 'Mystery', '20th Century', 'Noir', 'War']",34 review,62 (27%),90 (40%),55 (24%),12 (5%),3 (1%)

Mr. Jeremy has a day full of the worst fisherman's mishaps when he sets out to catch minnows for his dinner.The landscape that Peter Rabbit first introduced to us in 1902 is still today one of Beatrix Potter's most popular and well-loved worlds. What started as an endearing story about a bunny rabbit would soon become the first ember for the illustrious series that is 
'The World of Beatrix Potter'
 and a story which has endured retelling after retelling at bedtimes all over the world. 
Beatrix Potter
 (1866–1943) loved the countryside and spent much of her childhood drawing and studying animals. 'The Tale of Peter Rabbit', first published in 1902, was her first book. She later went on to publish more than twenty tales and collections of rhymes.Age Rating: 3–12+ / Preschool - 2+ / Lexile Measure 840L",57,"2,830","1,972 follower","['Childrens', 'Picture Books', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Animals', 'Fantasy', 'Short Stories']",294 review,"5,503 (45%)","3,504 (29%)","2,478 (20%)",456 (3%),95 (<1%)
