The Nonconformist's Memorial: Poems,Susan Howe,4.30,149 rating,"May 1, 1993","The Nonconformist's Memorial is a gathering of four long sequences that underscores Susan Howe's reputation as one of the leading experimentalists writing today. Howe is a poet of language in history whose work resonates back through Melville, Dickinson, and Shelley to the seventeenth-century Metaphysicals and Puritans (the nonconformism of the title), and forward again to T. S. Eliot and the abstract expressionists. The sequences fall into two sections, ""Turning"" and ""Conversion,"" in half-ironic nonconforming counterpart to Eliot's Four Quartets. Her collaging and mirror-imaging of words are concretions of verbal static, visual meditations on what can and cannot be said. For Howe, ""Melville's Marginalia"" is the essential poem in the collection, an approach to an elusive and allusive mind through Melville's own reading and the notations in his library books. This, says Howe, is ""Language a wood for thought.""",160,67,152 follower,['Poetry'],7 review,85 (57%),40 (26%),12 (8%),8 (5%),4 (2%)

For centuries, Antarctica has captured the imagination of our greatest scientists and explorers, lingering in the spirit long after their return. Shackleton called it ""the last great journey""; for Apsley Cherry-Garrard it was the worst journey in the world. This is a book about the call of the wild and the response of the spirit to a country that exists perhaps most vividly in the mind.

No Time to Say Goodbye: Surviving The Suicide Of A Loved One,Carla Fine,4.23,918 rating,"December 1, 1996","Suicide would appear to be the last taboo. Even incest is now discussed freely in the popular media, but the suicide of a loved one is still an act most people are unable to talk about--or even admit to their closest family and friends. This is just one of the many painful and paralyzing truths author Carla Fine discovered when her husband, a successful young physician, took his own life in December 1989. And being unable to speak openly and honestly about the cause of her pain made it all the more difficult for her to survive. With No Time to Say Goodbye, she brings suicide survival from the darkness into the light, speaking frankly and with compassion about the overwhelming feelings of confusion, guilt, shame, anger and loneliness that are shared by all survivors. Drawing on her own experience and on conversations with many other survivors--as well as on the knowledge of counselors and mental health professionals--Carla Fine offers a strong helping hand and invaluable guidance to the thousands of husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, friends and lovers who are left behind each year, struggling to make sense of an act that seems to them senseless, and to pick up the pieces of their own shattered lives. And, perhaps most important, she allows them to see that they are not alone in their feelings of grief and despair.Her resource section, listing organizations and survivor groups throughout the United States and Canada, as well as her bibliography of further reading, will, in themselves, provide invaluable information and support.",272,10,6 follower,"['Nonfiction', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Death', 'Memoir', 'Research']",116 review,433 (47%),318 (34%),128 (13%),25 (2%),14 (1%)

On a warm autumn night at Longshot Hall, Sir Gifford gets the shock of his life. Horrifically and inexplicably, he witnesses his own murder...Dennis Yates Wheatley (1897—1977) was an English author whose prolific output of stylish thrillers and occult novels made him one of the world's bestselling writers from the 1930s through the 1960s. His Gregory Sallust series was one of the main inspirations for Ian Fleming's James Bond stories. Born in South London, he was the eldest of three children of an upper-middle-class family, the owners of Wheatley & Son of Mayfair, a wine business. He admitted to little aptitude for schooling, and was expelled from Dulwich College. Soon after his expulsion Wheatley became a British Merchant Navy officer cadet on the training ship HMS Worcester. During the Second World War, Wheatley was a member of the London Controlling Section, which secretly coordinated strategic military deception and cover plans. His literary talents gained him employment with planning staffs for the War Office. He wrote numerous papers for the War Office, including suggestions for dealing with a German invasion of Britain. Dennis Wheatley died on 11th November 1977. During his life he wrote over 70 books and sold over 50 million copies.","PaperbackFirst published January 1, 1956",311,220 follower,"['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Occult', 'Gothic', 'Supernatural', 'Magic']",38 review,104 (25%),143 (35%),117 (29%),25 (6%),14 (3%)

Holy Terror: Andy Warhol Close Up,Bob Colacello,3.99,689 rating,"January 1, 1990","From Library JournalThe former editor of Andy Warhol's Interview magazine, Colacello has an insider's story to tell. This book is as bitchy and packed with names as its readers could want. The Andy Warhol Factory is described (not surprisingly) as an exploitative place where Andy got richer and richer while his drones worked harder and harder. Colacello's straightforward chronology of working and partying in Warhol's circle is tinged by his bitterness over a heavy workload and little pay at the Factory. His tone captures perfectly the self-obsessed philosophy that drove Warhol, his hangers-on, and the subculture of sex, drugs, parties, discos, and the New York art scene of the 1970s and early 1980s.

Nabokov's Pale Fire: The Magic of Artistic Discovery,Brian Boyd,4.28,267 rating,"January 1, 1999","Pale Fire is regarded by many as Vladimir Nabokov's masterpiece. The novel has been hailed as one of the most striking early examples of postmodernism and has become a famous test case for theories about reading because of the apparent impossibility of deciding between several radically different interpretations. Does the book have two narrators, as it first appears, or one? How much is fantasy and how much is reality? Whose fantasy and whose reality are they? Brian Boyd, Nabokov's biographer and hitherto the foremost proponent of the idea that Pale Fire has one narrator, John Shade, now rejects this position and presents a new and startlingly different solution that will permanently shift the nature of critical debate on the novel. Boyd argues that the book does indeed have two narrators, Shade and Charles Kinbote, but reveals that Kinbote had some strange and highly surprising help in writing his sections. In light of this interpretation, Pale Fire now looks distinctly less postmodern--and more interesting than ever.In presenting his arguments, Boyd shows how Nabokov designed Pale Fire for readers to make surprising discoveries on a first reading and even more surprising discoveries on subsequent readings by following carefully prepared clues within the novel. Boyd leads the reader step-by-step through the book, gradually revealing the profound relationship between Nabokov's ethics, aesthetics, epistemology, and metaphysics. If Nabokov has generously planned the novel to be accessible on a first reading and yet to incorporate successive vistas of surprise, Boyd argues, it is because he thinks a deep generosity lies behind the inexhaustibility, complexity, and mystery of the world. Boyd also shows how Nabokov's interest in discovery springs in part from his work as a scientist and scholar, and draws comparisons between the processes of readerly and scientific discovery.This is a profound, provocative, and compelling reinterpretation of one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century.",320,64,48 follower,"['Nonfiction', 'Criticism', 'Literary Criticism', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Russia']",29 review,120 (44%),108 (40%),34 (12%),4 (1%),1 (<1%)

He requests and is given writing materials in his cell, and what he has to recount is his involvement in the surveillance, torture, and assassination of Federigo and Enrique Salinas, a prominent father and son whose principled but passive opposition to the regime left them vulnerable to the secret police. Preying on young Enrique’s aimless life, the secret police began to position him as a subversive and then targeted his father. Once this plan was set into motion, any means were justified to reach the regime’s chosen end—the destruction of an entire liberal class.Inside Martens’s mind, we inhabit the rationalizing world of evil and see firsthand the inherent danger of inertia during times of crisis.

Wrinkles in Time,George Smoot,4.03,"1,246 rating","January 1, 1993","In April 1992, a discovery was made that changed the way we view the world. Dr. George Smoot, a distinguished cosmologist and adventurer whose quest for cosmic knowledge had taken him from the Brazilian rain forest to the South Pole, unveiled his momentous discovery, bringing to light the very nature of the universe. For anyone who has ever looked up at the night sky and wondered, for anyone who has ever longed to pull aside the fabric of the universe for a glimpse of what lies behind it. Wrinkles in Time is the story of Smoot's search to uncover the cosmic seeds of the universe.Wrinkles in Time is the Double Helix of cosmology, an intimate look at the inner world of men and women who ask. ""Why are we here?"" It tells the story of George Smoot's dogged pursuit of the cosmic wrinkles in the frozen wastes of Antarctica, on mountaintops, in experiments borne aloft aboard high-altitude balloons, U-2 spy planes, and finally a space satellite. Wrinkles in Time presents the hard science behind the structured violence of the big bang theory through breathtakingly clear, lucid images and meaningful comparisons. Scientists and nonscientists alike can follow with rapt attention the story of how, in a fiery creation, wrinkles formed in space ultimately to become stars, galaxies, and even greater delicate structures. Anyone can appreciate the implications of a universe whose end is written in its beginnings - whose course developed according to a kind of cosmic DNA, which guided the universe from simplicity and symmetry to ever-greater complexity and structure. As controversial as it may seem today, Wrinkles in Time reveals truths that, in an earlier century, would have doomed its proclaimers to the fiery stake. For four thousand years some people have accepted the Genesis account of cosmic origin; for most of this century, scientists debated two rival scientific explanations known as the steady state and big bang theories. And now, Wrinkles in Time tells what really happened. The personal story behind astrophysicist George Smoot's incredible discovery of the origin of the cosmos, hailed by Stephen Hawking as ""The scientific discovery of the century, if not of all time.""",360,7,30 follower,"['Science', 'Physics', 'Nonfiction', 'Astronomy', 'History', 'Biography', 'Space', 'Science', 'Physics', 'Nonfiction', 'Astronomy', 'History', 'Biography', 'Space', 'Science', 'Physics', 'Nonfiction', 'Astronomy', 'History', 'Biography', 'Space']",49 review,482 (38%),423 (33%),254 (20%),68 (5%),19 (1%)

It is desperation that inspires young widow Hannah McGarry to call Archer Donovan. She only saw the man twice in the past ten years, and he struck her as a cold, ruthless piece of work. But as a silent partner in Pearl Cove, her late husband's pearl farm business, Donovan might be willing to help her...if the price is right. At twenty-nine, Hannah has been freed to live her life again. Now she faces the mystery of her late husband's death, the prospect of bankruptcy...and the disappearance of the Black Trinity, a necklace containing a three million dollar fortune in black pearls that was supposed to be her financial security. Archer Donovan would rather forget he'd ever heard of Pearl Cove. It links him to memories of living life on the dark side, the old lure, the heart-pumping, soul-numbing certainty that there was no law, no justice, no mercy; just hunters and the hunted. That life had taught him to trust no one but family. But when Hannah McGarry calls in an old debt and offers a million dollars, Archer is plunged back into the hell he vowed never to revisit; into a deadly game of money, power, cutthroat competition, and treachery in pursuit of a stolen fortune. At his side is a woman he shouldn't want, yet cannot resist...a woman who may know more than she's telling about her husband's death...and more than is safe to know about the dark and elusive black pearls. With a feeding frenzy of human sharks on their tails, Archer and Hannah race through uncharted waters in search of the fabulous Black Trinity...and the closer they come to finding the coveted pearls, the closer they come to danger and death...and to each other.",432,203,"1,823 follower","['Romance', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Suspense', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Contemporary Romance']",112 review,"1,783 (37%)","1,783 (37%)",981 (20%),153 (3%),29 (<1%)

His protagonists are good ol' boys from New Brunswick who have grand ambitions to strike it big in Toronto – if they could just bring themselves to go. Somehow, their grand plans always lose priority to getting drunk, chasing women, and generally raising hell in rural New Brunswick. There's inertia in small-town life; no matter how you try to leave, you can find yourself stuck, unable to escape the life you know. Fraser understands that and captures all the hope and despair and futility of this situation. ""Critics and boosters praise Fraser for presenting characters that readers don't just want to know, but feel they already do know. While most writers want that popular appeal, few would deny the special thrill that comes from drawing the praise of their peers. Fraser is one of those fortunate writers, in no small part due to Bannonbridge, able to have both. His work has drawn praise from a veritable who's who of Canadian literature, including Farley Mowat, Leonard Cohen, and Alden Nowlan (with whom he shared a long friendship). ""The Bannonbridge Musicians is a book of soul and spirit. Fraser's characters are real and vibrant, enjoyable and maddening.

But when Eliza sweeps her school and district spelling bees in quick succession, Saul takes it as a sign that she is destined for greatness. In this altered reality, Saul inducts her into his hallowed study and lavishes upon her the attention previously reserved for Aaron, who in his displacement embarks upon a lone quest for spiritual fulfillment.

Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig von Mises,4.34,"3,969 rating","January 1, 1940","In the foreword to 
Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,
 Mises explains complex market phenomena as ""the outcomes of countless conscious, purposive actions, choices, and preferences of individuals, each of whom was trying as best as he or she could under the circumstances to attain various wants and ends and to avoid undesired consequences."" It is individual choices in response to personal subjective value judgments that ultimately determine market phenomena—supply and demand, prices, the pattern of production, and even profits and losses. Although governments may presume to set ""prices,"" it is individuals who, by their actions and choices through competitive bidding for money, products, and services, actually determine ""prices"". Thus, Mises presents economics—not as a study of material goods, services, and products—but as a study of human actions. He sees the science of human action, praxeology, as a science of reason and logic, which recognizes a regularity in the sequence and interrelationships among market phenomena. Mises defends the methodology of praxeology against the criticisms of Marxists, socialists, positivists, and mathematical statisticians.Mises attributes the tremendous technological progress and the consequent increase in wealth and general welfare in the last two centuries to the introduction of liberal government policies based on free-market economic teachings, creating an economic and political environment which permits individuals to pursue their respective goals in freedom and peace. Mises also explains the futility and counter-productiveness of government attempts to regulate, control, and equalize all people's circumstances: ""Men are born unequal and ... it is precisely their inequality that generates social cooperation and civilization.""Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973) was the leading spokesman of the Austrian School of Economics throughout most of the twentieth century. He earned his doctorate in law and economics from the University of Vienna in 1906. In 1926, Mises founded the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research. From 1909 to 1934, he was an economist for the Vienna Chamber of Commerce. Before the Anschluss, in 1934 Mises left for Geneva, where he was a professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies until 1940, when he emigrated to New York City. From 1948 to 1969, he was a visiting professor at New York University.Bettina Bien Greaves is a former resident scholar, trustee, and longtime staff member of the Foundation for Economic Education. She has written and lectured extensively on topics of free market economics. Her articles have appeared in such journals as Human Events, Reason, and The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty. A student of Mises, Greaves has become an expert on his work in particular and that of the Austrian School of economics in general. She has translated several Mises monographs, compiled an annotated bibliography of his work, and edited collections of papers by Mises and other members of the Austrian School.",924,223,"1,051 follower","['Economics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Finance', 'Classics', 'Economics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Finance', 'Classics', 'Economics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Finance', 'Classics']",212 review,"2,340 (58%)",992 (24%),394 (9%),133 (3%),110 (2%)

"Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945",David M. Kennedy,4.19,"5,129 rating","January 1, 1999","Between 1929 and 1945, two great travails were visited upon the American people: the Great Depression and World War II. This book tells the story of how Americans endured, and eventually prevailed, in the face of those unprecedented calamities.The Depression was both a disaster and an opportunity. As David Kennedy vividly demonstrates, the economic crisis of the 1930s was far more than a simple reaction to the alleged excesses of the 1920s. For more than a century before 1929, America's unbridled industrial revolution had gyrated through repeated boom and bust cycles, wastefully consuming capital and inflicting untold misery on city and countryside alike.Freedom From Fear explores how the nation agonized over its role in World War II, how it fought the war, why the United States won, and why the consequences of victory were sometimes sweet, sometimes ironic. In a compelling narrative, Kennedy analyzes the determinants of American strategy, the painful choices faced by commanders and statesmen, and the agonies inflicted on the millions of ordinary Americans who were compelled to swallow their fears and face battle as best they could.Both comprehensive and colorful, this account of the most convulsive period in American history, excepting only the Civil War, reveals a period that formed the crucible in which modern America was formed.",936,278,61 follower,"['History', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'World War II', 'Economics', 'American']",234 review,"2,385 (46%)","1,708 (33%)",767 (14%),178 (3%),91 (1%)

What Makes Sammy Run?,Budd Schulberg,4.10,"3,011 rating","January 1, 1941","What Makes Sammy Run?Everyone of us knows someone who runs. He is one of the symp-toms of our times—from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run?This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York’s East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic—his congenital incapacity for friendship.An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening.When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick’s real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.",320,80,82 follower,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Film', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'American']",301 review,"1,098 (36%)","1,264 (41%)",538 (17%),84 (2%),27 (<1%)
