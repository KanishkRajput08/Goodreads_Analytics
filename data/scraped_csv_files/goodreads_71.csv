La oscura historia de la prima Montse,Juan Marsé,3.66,307 rating,"January 1, 1970","Publicada por primera vez en 1970, La oscura historia de la prima Montse , ahora revisada y corregida por el autor, constituye el punto culminante de la madurez narrativa de Juan Marsé. La novela arranca con la visita de un hombre, diez años después, al lugar donde se fraguó su tragedia. Condenada al derribo, nada queda del antiguo esplendor de la torre de sus tíos, la adinerada, católica y encopetada familia de los Claramunt. Todo empezó cuando su prima, Montse Claramunt, joven idealista consagrada en la orden seglar de las Visitadoras a la caridad y el proselitismo entre el pueblo llano, conoció a un presidiario -estudiante ateo, atractivo y ambicioso, de clase obrera- y quiso convertirlo en su protegido, entender sus problemas y entregarse a él. De esas buenas y peligrosas intenciones surgirá una historia oscura, cuando se interpongan los estatutos sociales y el culto a la respetabilidad. Reseña:«El mundo de Marsé siempre tiene una rara cualidad de adviento. Como si la búsqueda de ese arte de la evocación, que es para él el arte del novelista, no fuera sino hacer visible a los otros la luz y el brillo del mundo. Señalar, como quería Joyce, el lugar de la epifanía.»Gustavo Martín Garzo",352,51,164 follower,"['Fiction', 'Drama', '20th Century', 'Spain', 'Spanish Literature']",29 review,48 (15%),134 (43%),101 (32%),21 (6%),3 (<1%)
Mouthing the words,Camilla Gibb,3.68,871 rating,"January 1, 1999","By turns harrowing and hilarious, this adroitly narrated tale re-creates the world in the imagination of Thelma. It's a world in which she can escape some of her more painful childhood realities, like those games her father likes to make her play, where he's the boss and she the naughty secretary. And her mother so fiercely favors her younger brother, the cherubic Willy, that Thelma finds herself perpetually in emotional exile. No wonder Thelma asks practically every adult she meets to adopt her. Along Thelma's bumpy way from a rural English village to Canada to a law degree at Oxford, she meets many potential parents and even makes some friends, but it is with the companions of her fertile imagination -- with the scaredy-baby Janawee, moody and timid Ginniger, and big, strong, stoic Heroin -- that Thelma finds comfort. With them, too, she loses an already tenuous connection to reality, though ultimately Thelma's spirit and humor prove to be as indomitable as her wit.","PaperbackFirst published January 1, 1999",17,295 follower,"['Fiction', 'Canada', 'Mental Illness', 'Novels', 'Mental Health', 'Abuse', 'Psychology']",90 review,202 (23%),312 (35%),253 (29%),83 (9%),21 (2%)

Υψικάμινος,Andreas Embirikos,4.16,178 rating,"March 1, 1935","Η Υψικάμινος, συλλογή 63 πεζόμορφων ποιημάτων, είναι το πρώτο κείμενο που εκδίδεται του Ανδρέα Εμπειρίκου. Τυπώθηκε σε 200 αριθμημένα αντίτυπα στις εκδ. Κασταλία, τον Μάρτιο του 1935 στην Αθήνα, 11 χρόνια μετά το Μανιφέστο του Υπερρεαλισμού του Αντρέ Μπρετόν στο Παρίσι. Λίγο καιρό πριν, στις 25 Ιανουαρίου 1935, ο Εμπειρίκος είχε δώσει τη διάλεξη ""Περί σουρρεαλισμού"" στη Λέσχη Καλλιτεχνών.Ο Εμπειρίκος γνωρίζει τον κύκλο των υπερρεαλιστών και μυείται στην τεχνική της αυτόματης γραφής τους γύρω στο 1929. Η Υψικάμινος αποτελεί ένα μοναδικό βιβλίο της νεοελληνικής ποιητικής παραγωγής. Κανένας ποιητής πριν, αλλά και κανένας μετά, δεν συγκρότησε ένα βιβλίο τόσο αιρετικό, τόσο κρυπτικό και ""ακατανόητο"", που ωστόσο εξαντλήθηκε γρήγορα, ""όχι από ενδιαφέρον αλλά επειδή εθεωρήθη βιβλίο σκανδαλώδες, γραμμένο από ένα παράφρονα"", όπως θυμάται ο ίδιος ο ποιητής. Χωρίς σημεία στίξεως, με γλώσσα κυρίως λόγια και εκζητημένη, με φράσεις ατέρμονες, με άψογη σύνταξη αλλά χωρίς προφανή λογικό ειρμό η Υψικάμινος ανταποκρίνεται στις επιταγές του ελεύθερου συνειρμού και της συνακόλουθης αυτόματης γραφής που είχε διακηρύξει ο Αντρέ Μπρετόν και η παρέα του. Δύσκολα όμως θα μπορούσε κάποιος να υποστηρίξει πειστικά ότι τα ποιήματα της Υψικαμίνου έχουν συγκροτηθεί 'αυτόματα' ή 'τυχαία', παρά το γεγονός ότι ο ίδιος ο Εμπειρίκος βεβαιώνει ότι τα ποιήματα αυτά δεν αναπτύσσονται πάντοτε 'εντός των συνειδητών ορίων'. Η συνταγή δεν πρόκειται να επαναληφθεί, όμως αυτός ο πειραματισμός πέτυχε να αναδείξει το αυθεντικότερο κείμενο του ελληνικού υπερρεαλισμού.

Man Is Wolf to Man: Surviving the Gulag,Janusz Bardach,4.35,850 rating,"January 1, 1998","FROM THE BOOK :""The pit I was ordered to dig had the precise dimensions of a casket. The NKVD officer carefully designed it. He measured my size with a stick, made lines on the forest floor, and told me to dig. He wanted to make sure I'd fit well inside.""In 1941 Janusz Bardach's death sentence was commuted to ten years' hard labor and he was sent to Kolyma―the harshest, coldest, and most deadly prison in Joseph Stalin's labor camp system―the Siberia of Siberias. The only English-language memoir since the fall of communism to chronicle the atrocities committed during the Stalinist regime, Bardach's gripping testimony explores the darkest corners of the human condition at the same time that it documents the tyranny of Stalin's reign, equal only to that of Hitler. With breathtaking immediacy, a riveting eye for detail, and a humanity that permeates the events and landscapes he describes, Bardach recounts the extraordinary story of this nearly inconceivable world.The story begins with the Nazi occupation when Bardach, a young Polish Jew inspired by Soviet Communism, crosses the border of Poland to join the ranks of the Red Army. His ideals are quickly shattered when he is arrested, court-martialed, and sentenced to death. How Bardach survives an endless barrage of brutality―from a near-fatal beating to the harsh conditions and slow starvation of the gulag existence―is a testament to human endurance under the most oppressive circumstances. Besides being of great historical significance, Bardach's narrative is a celebration of life and a vital affirmation of what it means to be human.",440,9,8 follower,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Russia', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Survival', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Russia', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Survival', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Russia', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Survival', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Russia', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Survival', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Russia', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Survival']",73 review,458 (53%),272 (32%),94 (11%),13 (1%),13 (1%)

The Beatles Anthology,The Beatles,4.38,"17,113 rating","September 1, 2000","This extraordinary project has been made possible because Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr have agreed to tell their combined story especially for this book. Together with Yoko Ono Lennon, they have also made available the full transcripts (including all the outtakes) of the television and video series The Beatles Anthology. Through painstaking compilation of sources worldwide, John Lennon's words are equally represented in this remarkable volume. Furthermore, The Beatles have opened their personal and management archives specifically for this project, allowing the unprecedented release of photographs which they took along their ride to fame, as well as fascinating documents and memorabilia from their homes and offices. What a book The Beatles Anthology is! Each page is brimming with personal stories and rare vintage images. Snapshots from their family collections take us back to the days when John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Richard Starkey were just boys growing up in Liverpool. They talk in turn about those early years and how they came to join the band that would make them known around the world as John, Paul, George and Ringo. Then, weaving back and forth, they tell the astonishing story of life as The Beatles: the first rough gigs, the phenomenon of their rise to fame, the musical and social change of their heyday, all the way through to their breakup. From the time Ringo tried to take this drum kit home on the bus to their much anticipated audience with Elvis, from the making of the Sgt. Pepper album to their last photo session together at John's house, The Beatles Anthology is a once-in-a-lifetime collection of The Beatles' own memories.Interwoven with these are the recollections of such associates as road manager Neil Aspinall, producer George Martin and spokesman Derek Taylor. And included in the vast array of photographs are materials from both Apple and EMI, who also opened their archives for this project. This, indeed, is the inside story, providing a wealth of previously unpublished material in both word and image.Created with their full cooperation, The Beatles Anthology is, in effect, The Beatles' autobiography.

Intelligent and independent, her future seems safe and predictable. Lovely Venetia despairs of ever meeting the handsome hero of her romantic dreams but is nearly resigned to spinsterhood, thanks to the enormous amount of responsibility she inherited with a Yorkshire estate and an invalid but precocious brother, Aubrey. She lives in comfortable seclusion in rural Yorkshire, she has never been further than Harrogate, nor enjoyed the lackluster attentions of any but her two wearisomely persistent suitors. She can not accept to marry the respectable but dull Edward Yardley - she will only marry for love.Then her long-absent neighbor, thirty-eight-year-old Lord Jasper Damerel, returns home to Yorkshire. In one extraordinary encounter, she meets the infamous neighbor, who she knows only by reputation - a gamester, a shocking rake, and a man of sadly unsteady character - and before she knows better, she finds friendship with a libertine whose way of life has scandalised the North Riding for years. Lord Damerel finds Venetia to be the most truly engaging and wittily perverse female he has encountered in all his life and determined to woo and win her, he pursues her with a passionate abandon that is soon the talk of the ton. And after her encounter with the dashing, dangerous rake, Venetia's well-ordered life is turned upside down, and she embarks upon a courtship with him that scandalises and horrifies the whole community.But Venetia has no intention of losing her heart to the rakish lord until she is sure that beneath his swashbuckling ways and shocking manners lies a tender heart belonging to her.

He had spent in all more than forty years in service at Court; his experience was unique and his passing was comparable to that of an institution.Sir Frederick stipulated that his reminiscences were not to be published until the last of Queen Victoria's children had died. ""The choice of the date at which memoirs should be published"", said the late Algernon Cecil in his review of this book, ""has never been easy."" But posterity relies upon personal memoirs which, to quote Mr. Roger Fulford, are ""ample, fascinating and not damaged by mere tittle-tattle"", and it was immediately recognized that Recollections of Three Reigns is high in this class.""The character sketches are shrewd and admirable and those of the Sovereigns he served are exceptionally valuable. There is a good deal of wisdom and good sense from the store of his vast experience. Some of the country house parties are as amusingly described as Creevy's. Apart from the wit and gaiety there is permanent value in the memoirs. The reader has the good fortune to hear again the voice of Fritz Ponsonby, that Prince of dwardian entertainers, discoursing over the wine, pungent, pointed, polished, never treacherous.""John Gore in the Spectator""A linguist, a man of the world and a prodigy of fact, discretion and loyalty, Sir Frederick had every qualification for a courtier.

Eva is a naturally gifted and imaginative storyteller who meets people from all stations and walks of life.

In this novel, she shares the story of her own life and introduces readers to a diverse and eccentric cast of characters including the Lebanese émigré who befriends her and takes her in; her unfortunate godmother, whose brain is addled by rum and who believes in all the Catholic saints and a few of her own invention; a street urchin who grows into a petty criminal and, later, a leader in the guerrilla struggle; a celebrated transsexual entertainer who instructs her in the ways of the adult world; and a young refugee whose flight from postwar Europe will prove crucial to Eva's fate.As Eva tells her story, Isabel Allende conjures up a whole complex South American nation—the rich, the poor, the simple, and the sophisticated—in a novel replete with character and incident, with drama and comedy and history, with battles and passions, rebellions and reunions, a novel that celebrates the power of imagination to create a better world.",307,192,38.4k follower,"['Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Romance', 'Spanish Literature', 'Latin American']","2,315 review","16,809 (32%)","21,541 (41%)","11,672 (22%)","2,039 (3%)",422 (<1%)

Here he records and traces Dada’s history, from its inception in about 1916 in wartime Zurich, to its collapse in Paris in 1922 when many of its members were to join the Surrealist movement, down to the present day when its spirit re-emerged first in the 1960s with, for example, Pop Art.This absorbing eye witness narrative is greatly enlivened by extensive use of Dada documents, illustrations and a variety of texts by fellow Dadaists. It is a unique document of the movement, whether in Zurich, Berlin, Hanover, Paris or New York.

Os sapatos de Orfeu: Biografia de Carlos Drummond de Andrade,José Maria Cançado,4.27,11 rating,"371 pages, Brochura","Não é tarefa nem um pouco simples tentar escrever uma biografia de Carlos Drummond de Andrade, sempre tão discreto em relação à sua vida privada. Jose Maria Cançado realizou o enorme esforço de, num território com grandes regiões desérticas, encontrar os rastros deixados pelo poeta para nos contar a história de uma vida muito especial, que falou pela boca de milhões de seres humanos e deixou obra das mais importantes na literatura no Brasil do século XX. E isso sem cair nas armadilhas típicas da forma biográfica, que ora reduzem o homem a obra, ora deduzem os textos de eventos biográficos discretos, supondo com isso ter explicado o individuo ou seu trabalho. E notável assim, o cuidado com que Cançado traça linhas possíveis entre um verso e um acontecimento da vida de Drummond ou suas opções e orientações existenciais, não para chegar ao estabelecimento de relações ingênuas de causa e efeito, mas para efetivar uma operação de entendimento dos caminhos percorridos pelo homem e poeta e que transcendem em muito os versos e fatos inicialmente conectados. Trata-se de um inteligente procedimento por sugestões e contrastes, que não recusa a metáfora como modo de compreensão. Daí um texto saboroso, uma narrativa sem a sisudez acadêmica e suas formas canônicas, com a consciência alerta do relato como construção e a obediência à difícil regra de nunca resvalar pelo registro ficcional",371,6,6 book,[],0 review,5 (45%),5 (45%),0 (0%),1 (9%),0 (0%)

Luminile şi umbrele sufletului,Petru Creţia,4.36,315 rating,"January 1, 1995","Cartea aceasta nu vrea să fie altceva decât o călăuză către adevărul despre noi înşine, pe un drum la fel de greu de desluşit ca acela din Călăuza lui Tarkovski. Dar nu de negăsit. Omul este o fiinţă complicată şi ambiguă, dar nu indescifrabilă. Destul de chinuită şi de vulnerabilă, dar nu damnată. Iar sufletul său este în stare să compenseze urâţeniile şi josniciile naturii sale cu neverosimile biruinţe şi elevaţii...Atenţia noastră este prea mult chemată în afară, către zarva înverşunată a vieţii. Prea mulţi caută, tot timpul, să ne vândă ceva: o idee sau doar o marfă, un idol sau, prea adesea, o iluzie. Cum să-ţi mai găseşti reperele în noianul acesta de informaţii şi de ispite care par a spune totul despre noi şi a ne da toate soluţiile, când de fapt nu izbutim să aflăm despre noi înşine ceea ce ar face ca relaţia noastră cu lumea să devină, dacă nu mai uşoară, cel puţin mai limpede?Asemenea informaţii vrea să dea, pe scurt, dar în adânc, cartea aceasta prin eseurile morale pe care le conţine.
