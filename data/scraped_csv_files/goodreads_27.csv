The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner,Alan Sillitoe,3.78,"6,540 rating","January 1, 1959","Nine classic short stories portraying the isolation, criminality, morality, and rebellion of the working class from award-winning, bestselling author Alan Sillitoe The titular story follows the internal decisions and external oppressions of a seventeen-year-old inmate in a juvenile detention center who is known only by his surname, Smith. The wardens have given the boy a light workload because he shows talent as a runner. But if he wins the national long-distance running competition as everyone is counting on him to do, Smith will only vindicate the very system and society that has locked him up. “The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner” has long been considered a masterpiece on both the page and the silver screen. Adapted for film by Sillitoe himself in 1962, it became an instant classic of British New Wave cinema.    In “Uncle Ernest,” a middle-aged furniture upholsterer traumatized in World War II, now leads a lonely life. His wife has left him, his brothers have moved away, and the townsfolk treat him as if he were a ghost. When the old man finally finds companionship with two young girls whom he enjoys buying pastries for at a café, the local authorities find his behavior morally suspect. “Mr. Raynor the School Teacher” delves into a different kind of isolation—that of a voyeuristic teacher who fantasizes constantly about the women who work in a draper’s shop across the street. When his students distract him from his lustful daydreams, Mr. Raynor becomes violent.   The six stories that follow in this iconic collection continue to cement Alan Sillitoe’s reputation as one of Britain’s foremost storytellers, and a champion of the condemned, the oppressed, and the overlooked.   This ebook features an illustrated biography of Alan Sillitoe including rare images from the author’s estate.  ",176,"['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Sports', 'Literature', 'British Literature', '20th Century']",125 follower,550 review,135,90 (1%),426 (6%),"1,779 (27%)","2,766 (42%)","1,479 (22%)"

L'année dernière à Marienbad,Alain Robbe-Grillet,4.18,316 rating,"January 1, 1961","Tout le film est l'histoire d'une persuasion : il s'agit d'une réalité que le héros crée par sa propre vision, par sa propre parole.Cela se passe dans un grand hôtel, une sorte de palace international. Un inconnu erre de salle en salle, longe d'interminables corridors. Son œil passe d'un visage sans nom à un autre visage sans nom. Mais il revient sans cesse à celui d'une jeune femme. Et voilà qu'il lui offre un passé, un avenir et la liberté. Il lui dit qu'ils se sont rencontrés déjà, lui et elle, il y a un an, qu'ils se sont aimés, qu'il revient maintenant à ce rendez-vous fixé par elle-même, et qu'il va l'emmener avec lui.L'inconnu est-il un banal séducteur ? Est-il un fou ? Ou bien confond-il seulement deux visages ? La jeune femme, en tout cas, commence par prendre la chose comme un jeu. Mais l'homme ne rit pas. Obstiné, grave, sûr de cette histoire passée que peu à peu il dévoile, il insiste, il apporte des preuves... Et la jeune femme, peu à peu, comme à regret, cède du terrain. Puis elle prend peur. Elle se raidit. Elle ne veut pas quitter cet autre homme qui veille sur elle et qui est peut-être son mari. Mais l'histoire que l'inconnu raconte prend corps de plus en plus, irrésistiblement, elle devient de plus en plus vraie. Le présent, le passé, du reste, ont fini par se confondre, tandis que la tension croissante entre les trois protagonistes crée dans l'esprit de l'héroïne des phantasmes de tragédie : le viol, le meurtre, le suicide.Puis soudain, elle va céder... Elle a déjà cédé, en fait, depuis longtemps. Après une dernière tentative pour se dérober, elle semble accepter d'être celle que l'inconnu attend, et de s'en aller avec lui vers quelque chose, quelque chose d'innommé, quelque chose d'autre : l'amour, la poésie, la liberté... ou, peut-être, la mort...Ciné-roman, illustré de photogrammes du film réalisé par Alain Resnais (1961).",176,"['Film', 'France', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Fantasy', 'French Literature', 'Plays']",380 follower,17 review,119,3 (<1%),12 (3%),52 (16%),108 (34%),141 (44%)

The matter: a deadly betrayal, unspoken and unspeakable, born of political enmity. As the boy listens through the silence that surrounds him, the truth spreads like a stain until it engulfs him and his family. And as he listens, and watches, the world of legend--the stone fort of Grianan, home of the warrior Fianna; the Field of the Disappeared, over which no gulls fly--reveals its transfixing reality. Meanwhile the real world of adulthood unfolds its secrets like a collection of folktales: the dead sister walking again; the lost uncle, Eddie, present on every page; the family house ""as cunning and articulate as a labyrinth, closely designed, with someone sobbing at the heart of it.""Seamus Deane has created a luminous tale about how childhood fear turns into fantasy and fantasy turns into fact.

In some ways, the media frenzy over the rating overshadowed the harrowing portrait of teenagers destroying their lives and the then twenty-one-year-old screenwriter who created them. ""Whether you see the movie as a masterpiece or as sensationalism,"" wrote Lynn Hirshberg, ""the movie is relentless and brilliant and extremely disturbing. It's powerful-both steel-eyed and sexy; horrifying and captivating.""Now, in this first book of fictional set pieces, Korine captures the fragmented moments of a life observed through the demented lens of media, TV, and teen obsession. Korine reinvents the novel in this highly experimental montage of scenes that seem both real and surreal at the same time. With a filmmaker's eye and a prankster's glee, this bizarre collection of jokes, half-remembered scenes, dialogue fragments, movie ideas, and suicide notes is an episodic, epigrammatic lovesong to the world of images.

The Pushcart War,Jean Merrill,4.19,"4,767 rating","January 1, 1964","DO YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE PUSHCART WAR? THE REAL HISTORY? It’s a story of how regular people banded together and, armed with little more than their brains and good aim, defeated a mighty foe.Not long ago the streets of New York City were smelly, smoggy, sooty, and loud. There were so many trucks making deliveries that it might take an hour for a car to travel a few blocks. People blamed the truck owners and the truck owners blamed the little wooden pushcarts that traveled the city selling everything from flowers to hot dogs. Behind closed doors the truck owners declared war on the pushcart peddlers. Carts were smashed from Chinatown to Chelsea. The peddlers didn’t have money or the mayor on their side, but that didn’t stop them from fighting back. They used pea shooters to blow tacks into the tires of trucks, they outwitted the police, and they marched right up to the grilles of those giant trucks and dared them to drive down their streets. Today, thanks to the ingenuity of the pushcart peddlers, the streets belong to the people—and to the pushcarts.The Pushcart War was first published more than fifty years ago. It has inspired generations of children and been adapted for television, radio, and the stage around the world.

Rainbow Six, however, goes beyond anything he has done before.At its heart is John Clark, the ex-Navy SEAL of Without Remorse, well known from several of Clancy's novels as a master of secret operational missions. Whether hunting warlords in Japan, druglords in Colombia, or nuclear terrorists in the United States, Clark is efficient and deadly, but even he has ghosts in his past, demons that must be exorcised. And nothing is more demonic than the peril he must face in Rainbow Six.Newly named the head of an international task force dedicated to combating terrorism, Clark is looking forward to getting his teeth into a new mission, but the opportunities start coming thicker and faster than anyone could have expected: an incident at a Swiss bank, the kidnapping of an international trader in Germany, a terrible raid on an amusement park in Spain.Each episode seems separate, discrete, yet the timing disturbs Clark. Is there a connection? Is he being tested? With the help of his close associates, executive officer Alistair Stanley and strike team leaders Domingo Chavez and Peter Covington, Clark tries to figure out where all this activity is heading, but there is no way to predict the real threat: a group of terrorists like none the world has ever encountered, a band of men and women so extreme that their success could literally mean the end of life on Earth as we know it.",912,"['Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Military Fiction', 'Action', 'Espionage', 'Adventure', 'Suspense', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Military Fiction', 'Action', 'Espionage', 'Adventure', 'Suspense', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Military Fiction', 'Action', 'Espionage', 'Adventure', 'Suspense']","8,014 follower","1,396 review",660,651 (1%),"2,143 (3%)","9,536 (17%)","19,355 (35%)","22,466 (41%)"

We own devices that bring the world to the command of our fingertips. We have access to boundless information and prodigious quantities of stuff. We decide to like or not, to believe or not, to buy or not. We pick and choose. We think we are free. Yet all around us, in pop culture, politics, mainstream media, and advertising, there are codes and symbols that govern our choices. They are the fabrications of consumer society. They express myths of success, well-being, and happiness. As Barthes sees it, these myths must be carefully deciphered, and debunked.What Barthes discerned in mass media, the fashion of plastic, and the politics of postcolonial France applies with equal force to today's social networks, the iPhone, and the images of 9/11.

"Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man: The Early Years",Thomas Mann,3.83,"4,877 rating","January 1, 1954","Thomas Mann's final novel recounts the strange and entranced career of the gifted swindler, Felix Krull, through his childhood and early manhood. Krull is a man unhampered by moral precepts that govern the conduct of ordinary mortals, and this natural lack of scruple, coupled with his formidable mental and physical endowments, enables him to develop the arts of subterfuge and deception with astonishing success and to rise swiftly from poverty to affluence. Following Krull along the shady paths his nature has destined him to take, the reader moves through a world peopled by bizarre characters from the lowest to the highest reaches of European society. Chameleon-like, Krull readily adapts himself to the situation of the moment, and so adept in the practices of chicanery does he become that his victims almost seem to count themselves privileged. And so it is too with the women who encounter the irresistible Krull, for where Krull is, the normal laws of human behavior are in suspense.Originally the character of Felix Krull appeared in a short story Mann wrote in 1911. The story wasn't published until 1936, in the book Stories of Three Decades along with 23 other stories written from 1896 to 1929, the year in which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Much later, he expanded the original story into a novel, managing to finish and publish Part 1, ""The Early Years,"" of the Confessions of Felix Krull to great public success. Due to Mann's death in 1955 the saga of the morally flexible and irresistible con-man remains unfinished.",400,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Germany', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Novels']","4,370 follower",297 review,"1,449",110 (2%),336 (6%),"1,200 (24%)","1,849 (37%)","1,382 (28%)"

Her blue eyes were the sort a man could drown in-were it not for her impudence. She questioned his every move, breached his secrets, touched his soul. When he offered to set her up in his London town house, love was the last thing on his mind....
