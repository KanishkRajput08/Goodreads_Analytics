Making History,Stephen Fry,3.93,"11,279 rating","October 22, 1996","In Making History, Stephen Fry has bitten off a rather meaty chunk by tackling an at first deceptively simple premise: What if Hitler had never been born? An unquestionable improvement, one would reason--and so an earnest history grad student and an aging German physicist idealistically undertake to bring this about by preventing Adolf's conception. And with their success is launched a brave new world that is in some ways better than ours--but in most ways even worse. Fry's experiment in history makes for his most ambitious novel yet, and his most affecting.

Theophilus North,Thornton Wilder,4.03,"1,100 rating","January 1, 1973","Marking the thirtieth anniversary of Theophilus North, this beautiful new edition features Wilder's unpublished notes for the novel and other illuminating documentary material, all of which is included in a new Afterword by Tappan Wilder. The last of Wilder's works published during his lifetime, this novel is part autobiographical and part the imagined adventure of his twin brother who died at birth. Setting out to see the world in the summer of 1926, Theophilus North gets as far as Newport, Rhode Island, before his car breaks down. To support himself, Theophilus takes jobs in the elegant mansions along Ocean Drive, just as Wilder himself did in the same decade. Soon the young man finds himself playing the roles of tutor, spy, confidant, lover, friend, and enemy as he becomes entangled in the intrigues of both upstairs and downstairs in a glittering society dominated by leisure. Narrated by the elderly North from a distance of fifty years, Theophilus North is a fascinating commentary on youth and education from the vantage point of age, and deftly displays Wilder's trademark wit juxtaposed with his lively and timeless ruminations on what really matters about life, love, and work at the end of the day -- even after a visit to Newport.",351,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'American', '20th Century', 'Novels', 'Literature']",435 follower,127 review,213,16 (1%),52 (4%),214 (19%),414 (37%),404 (36%)

"Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974",James T. Patterson,4.10,"1,180 rating","April 18, 1996","Beginning in 1945, America rocketed through a quarter-century of extraordinary economic growth, experiencing an amazing boom that soared to unimaginable heights in the 1960s. At one point, in the late 1940s, American workers produced 57 percent of the planet's steel, 62 percent of the oil, 80 percent of the automobiles. The U.S. then had three-fourths of the world's gold supplies. English Prime Minister Edward Heath later said that the United States in the post-War era enjoyed ""the greatest prosperity the world has ever known."" It was a boom that produced a national euphoria, a buoyant time of grand expectations and an unprecedented faith in our government, in our leaders, and in the American dream--an optimistic spirit which would be shaken by events in the '60s and '70s, and particularly by the Vietnam War.Now, in Grand Expectations, James T. Patterson has written a highly readable and balanced work that weaves the major political, cultural, and economic events of the period into a superb portrait of America from 1945 through Watergate. Here is an era teeming with memorable events--from the bloody campaigns in Korea and the bitterness surrounding McCarthyism to the assassinations of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King, to the Vietnam War, Watergate, and Nixon's resignation. Patterson excels at portraying the amazing growth after World War II--the great building boom epitomized by Levittown (the largest such development in history) and the baby boom (which exploded literally nine months after V-J Day)--as well as the resultant buoyancy of spirit reflected in everything from streamlined toasters, to big, flashy cars, to the soaring, butterfly roof of TWA's airline terminal in New York. And he shows how this upbeat, can-do mood spurred grander and grander expectations as the era progressed.Of course, not all Americans shared in this economic growth, and an important thread running through the book is an informed and gripping depiction of the civil rights movement--from the electrifying Brown v. Board of Education decision, to the violent confrontations in Little Rock, Birmingham, and Selma, to the landmark civil rights acts of 1964 and 1965. Patterson also shows how the Vietnam War--which provoked LBJ's growing credibility gap, vast defense spending that dangerously unsettled the economy, and increasingly angry protests--and a growing rights revolution (including demands by women, Hispanics, the poor, Native Americans, and gays) triggered a backlash that widened hidden rifts in our society, rifts that divided along racial, class, and generational lines. And by Nixon's resignation, we find a national mood in stark contrast to the grand expectations of ten years earlier, one in which faith in our leaders and in the attainability of the American dream was greatly shaken.The Oxford History of the United StatesThe Oxford History of the United States is the most respected multi-volume history of our nation.

Znakovi pored puta,Ivo Andrić,4.48,"1,771 rating","January 1, 1976","=Signs Along the Road: The collection of these notes entitled ""Znakovi pored puta""/ ""Signs by the roadside"" as well as ""Sveske""/""Notebooks"", published after Andrić’s death, can be best described as the writer's intellectual diaries. As may be imagined of a man who recoiled so consistently from any exposure of his private life and thoughts, Andrić was equally consistent in his dislike of the diary as a genre, seeing it as a misguided search for permanence.Ova ""knjige mudrosti"", ""vrsta intimnih dnevnika"", koje je Andri pisao celog ivota, smatraju se jedinstvenim u naoj knjievnosti i stoga jer je pisac u njima prvi put nedvosmisleno progovorio o sebi.Dnevnicki u Andricevim Znakovima pored puta jeste kratki tekst koji se moze napisati u toku jednog dana, u kome pisac ispusuje trenutno raspolozenje, vidjenje neke pojave, licnosti, utisak sa puta ili misao koja ga preokupira. Godinama belezene i bez odredjenog reda pisane takve zapise pisac sabira u knjigu koja postaje ogledalo njegove duse, a ne dnevnik. Princip organizacije tekstova u knjizi nije tok vremena, kao sto je u klasicnom dnevniku, vec spontani rad duse koja zivo i osetljivo reaguje na svakodnevne posticaje i preradjuje ih u meditacije i vizije, u snimke predela i ljudi. Spontanost i neobaveznost glavna su odlika takvog, viseg, duhovnog dnevnika kakvi su Znakovi pored puta. Tekst u njima raste i razvija se kao organsko tkivo: jedan fragment naslanja se na drugi, a ovaj na sledeci i tako do u nedogled. Ta ogranicenost i spontano stapanje manjih tekstova u vece celine, delo, jedna je od glavnih odlika Andricevog radnog postupka.",624,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Serbian Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Short Stories']","1,127 follower",29 review,271,12 (<1%),31 (1%),160 (9%),467 (26%),"1,101 (62%)"
Understanding Analysis,Stephen Abbott,4.45,378 rating,"January 1, 2000",This elementary presentation exposes readers to both the process of rigor and the rewards inherent in taking an axiomatic approach to the study of functions of a real variable. The aim is to challenge and improve mathematical intuition rather than to verify it. The philosophy of this book is to focus attention on questions which give analysis its inherent fascination. Each chapter begins with the discussion of some motivating examples and concludes with a series of questions.,272,"['Mathematics', 'Textbooks', 'Nonfiction', 'Reference', 'Science', 'Academic', 'Education']",4 follower,33 review,15,4 (1%),8 (2%),30 (7%),108 (28%),228 (60%)
The Idea of India,Sunil Khilnani,3.84,"1,026 rating","July 3, 1997","A classic since it was first published in 1997, The Idea of India is a magisterial historical study that addresses the paradoxes and ironies of the world's largest democracy. When, in 1947, the British divided and departed their most prized imperial possession, they handed a huge, diverse, and poor society to a small nationalist elite. For decades this elite would uphold a political construct, an idea of India grounded in democracy, religious tolerance, economic development, and cultural pluralism. Sunil Khilnani investigates the fate of this idea, offering incisive portraits of Gandhi, Nehru, and other Indian founders and assessing the lively debates among them and their successors over who is an Indian, the meaning of modernity, and India's place in the world.In a new introduction written for this edition, Khilnani reflects on the book's striking relevance to the country's recent developments--from the rise of a new billionaire class to the election of a government with a more exclusivist conception of Indian identity. Throughout, he provokes readers and illuminates a fundamental question as urgent now as ever: Can the original idea of India survive its own successes?",264,"['India', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Cultural', 'Indian Literature', 'Political Science']",72 follower,89 review,12,27 (2%),54 (5%),259 (25%),403 (39%),283 (27%)

The Time-Image,Gilles Deleuze,4.18,"1,208 rating","January 1, 1985","Cinema 2: The Time-Image brings to completion Gilles Deleuze's work on the theoretical implications of the cinematographic image. In Cinema 1: The Movement-Image, Deleuze proposed a new way to understand narrative cinema, based on Henri Bergson's notion of the movement-image and C.S. Pierce's classification of images and signs. In Cinema 2, he explains why, since World War II, time has come to dominate film: the fragment or solitary image, in supplanting narrative cinema's rational development of events, illustrates this new significance of time. Deleuze ascribes this shift to the condition of postwar Europe: the situations and spaces 'we no longer know how to describe'—buildings deserted but inhabited, cities undergoing demolition or reconstruction—and the new race of characters who emerged from this rubble, mutants who 'saw rather than acted.' Deleuze discusses the films of Rossellini, De Sica, Fellini, Godard, Resnais, Antonioni, Pasolini, Rohmer, Ophuls, and many others, suggesting that contemporary cinema, far from being dead, is only beginning to find new ways to capture time in the image.",362,"['Philosophy', 'Film', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Art', 'France', 'Cultural Studies']","2,125 follower",29 review,272,25 (2%),52 (4%),170 (14%),391 (32%),570 (47%)
