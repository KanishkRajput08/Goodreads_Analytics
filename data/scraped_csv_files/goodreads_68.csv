The Mismeasure of Man,Stephen Jay Gould,4.05,"8,884 rating","October 28, 1982","The definitive refutation to the argument of The Bell Curve.How smart are you? If that question doesn't spark a dozen more questions in your mind (like ""What do you mean by 'smart,'"" ""How do I measure it"" and ""Who's asking?""), then The Mismeasure of Man, Stephen Jay Gould's masterful demolition of the IQ industry, should be required reading. Gould's brilliant, funny, engaging prose dissects the motivations behind those who would judge intelligence, and hence worth, by cranial size, convolutions, or score on extremely narrow tests. How did scientists decide that intelligence was unipolar and quantifiable? Why did the standard keep changing over time? Gould's answer is clear and simple: power maintains itself. European men of the 19th century, even before Darwin, saw themselves as the pinnacle of creation and sought to prove this assertion through hard measurement. When one measure was found to place members of some ""inferior"" group such as women or Southeast Asians over the supposedly rightful champions, it would be discarded and replaced with a new, more comfortable measure. The 20th-century obsession with numbers led to the institutionalization of IQ testing and subsequent assignment to work (and rewards) commensurate with the score, shown by Gould to be not simply misguided--for surely intelligence is multifactorial--but also regressive, creating a feedback loop rewarding the rich and powerful. The revised edition includes a scathing critique of Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve, taking them to task for rehashing old arguments to exploit a new political wave of uncaring belt tightening. It might not make you any smarter, but The Mismeasure of Man will certainly make you think.--Rob LightnerThis edition is revised and expanded, with a new introduction",446,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Psychology', 'Anthropology', 'Biology', 'Sociology']","1,282 follower",460 review,189,188 (2%),397 (4%),"1,610 (18%)","3,257 (36%)","3,432 (38%)"

With this stunning novel about a woman and a marriage that begins in passion and becomes violent, the Pulitzer Prize--winning journalist and bestselling author of One True Thing and Object Lessons moves to a new dimension as a writer of superb fiction. ""If literature were judged solely by its ability to elicit strong emotions,"" Kirkus Reviews said about One True Thing, ""columnist-cum-novelist Quindlen would win another Pulitzer."" And the same will be said about Black and Blue, a brilliant novel of suspense, substance, and importance. In Black and Blue, Fran Benedetto tells a spellbinding story: how at nineteen she fell in love with Bobby Benedetto, how their passionate marriage became a nightmare, why she stayed, and what happened on the night she finally decided to run away with her ten-year-old son and start a new life under a new name. Living in fear in Florida--yet with increasing confidence, freedom, and hope--Fran unravels the complex threads of family, identity, and desire that shape a woman's life, even as she begins to create a new one. As Fran starts to heal from the pain of the past, she almost believes she has escaped it--that Bobby Benedetto will not find her and again provoke the complex combustion between them of attraction and destruction, lust and love. Black and Blue is a beautifully written, heart-stopping story in which Anna Quindlen writes with power, wisdom, and humor about the real lives of men and women, the varieties of people and love, the bonds between mother and child, the solace of family and friendship, the inexplicable feelings between people who are passionately connected in ways they don't understand. It is a remarkable work of fiction by the writer whom Alice Hoffman has called ""a national treasure.""",4,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Chick Lit', 'Adult Fiction', 'Abuse', 'Novels', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Chick Lit', 'Adult Fiction', 'Abuse', 'Novels', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Chick Lit', 'Adult Fiction', 'Abuse', 'Novels', 'Drama']","3,974 follower","1,864 review",97,"1,000 (1%)","4,138 (5%)","21,181 (25%)","32,767 (39%)","23,234 (28%)"

From a meditation on the relevance of Platonic ideas about happiness to a running commentary on the author's week at a ""happy camp"" in Massachusetts, this is an utterly absorbing and often hilarious exploration of just what it is that makes life worth living.",416,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help']",51 follower,9 review,53,1 (<1%),8 (7%),41 (38%),36 (33%),21 (19%)

This hallucinatory document of dreams, obsession, and insanity has fascinated artists such as Joseph Cornell, who cited passages from it to explain his own work; Antonin Artaud, who saw his own madness mirrored by Nerval's; and Andre Breton, who placed Nerval in the highest echelon of Surrealist heroes.

The Golden Fleece,Robert Graves,4.06,"1,043 rating","January 1, 1944","Reissued by Creative Age Press in 1945 as Hercules, My Shipmate, a novel about the voyage of the Argo. Written with ideas on The White Goddess as a cultural/anthropological backdrop to the ancient Greek tale. What the Golden Fleece really was—a cloak tossed to earth by a drunken Zeus, a sheepskin book of alchemic secrets or the gilded epidermis of a young human sacrifice named Mr. Ram—nobody knows. But Graves is quite sure that, whatever the Golden Fleece was, the voyage of Jason & his Argonauts really happened. His story shows the legendary cruise as one of the bawdiest, bloodiest, most boisterous expeditions of all time.  In I, Claudius & its Claudius the God sequel, Graves brought the teeming life of Claudian Rome so vividly alive that they became bestsellers. In the not-so-successful Wife to Mr. Milton, his blend of imagination & scholarship projected his readers into 17th-Century England & the bedchamber temper tantrums of the blind poet-politician.  With Hercules & shipmates, Graves becomes an ancient Greek, moving among demigods & goddesses, myths & monsters with an easy familiarity & a wealth of erudite detail. Both sometimes seem too much of a good thing. Atomic-age readers, ill-attuned to the leisurely, formal talk of myth-age Greeks, may find themselves skipping some of the longer speeches.  Most of the Argo's 50-oar crew were princes, each with a special talent & gift of the gods. The only woman aboard was a princess: Atalanta of Calydon, a virgin huntress who could outrun any man in Greece. Argus, who built the Argo, was the world's finest shipwright. Castor & Pollux, sons of Leda & Zeus-as-swan, were champion prizefighters. Nauplius, Poseidon's son, was an unrivaled navigator. Orpheus could make sticks & stones dance to his lyre. Hercules of Tiryns was the world's strongest man. He would've captained the Argonauts were it not that in moments of insanity he murdered friend & foe alike.  Captaincy devolved on Jason of lolcos—a man nobody liked or trusted, but who had a power denied to all the others: women instantly fell in love with him. Even surly Hercules agreed it a quality worth all the rest.  Backed by divine blessings & equinoctal winds, the Argonauts set sail. On the Island of Lemnos, peopled solely by women, they generously stopped off to help out with spring sowing. Nine months later, 200 children were born, of whom no less than 60 were said to be the spitting image of Hercules.  On Samothrace, they were initiated into the sacred mysteries. The Goddess of All Being mated with the Serpent Priapus to be delivered of a bull. Then the sacred nymphs leapt on them & scratched & bit until even Hercules passed out. Thereafter, the Argonauts glowed with ""a faint nimbus of light.""  The Argonauts boldly pushed on thru the dread Hellespont & entered the Black Sea. To their dismay, Hercules deserted, summoned home to perform another of his mighty labors. ""Holy Serpents!"" he growled. ""Tell me what this time?"" The job—cleaning the Augean Stables—didn't take long. He stayed around afterwards with the Lydian high priestess—who in due time bore male triplets. In gratitude, she taught him to spin, tying up his hair in blue braids. He was crazy about it, admitting confidentially he'd always wanted to be a woman. The Argonauts went on without Hercules. Reaching Colchis, Aphrodite won the Fleece for them. She made her son Eros wait behind a pillar with his bow until handsome Jason strode into the King of Colchis' palace. Eros shot Medea thru the heart, & the smitten princess helped to get the Fleece from her father's temple. Mythology's most famous voyage had reached its goal, but Graves takes 150 more pages to wind things up.",555,"['Mythology', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Greece', 'Greek Mythology']","1,635 follower",102 review,479,19 (1%),46 (4%),174 (16%),420 (40%),384 (36%)

With a sure grasp of shifting cultural dynamics, Banes shows how postmodern dance is integrally connected to other oppositional, often marginalized strands of dance culture, and considers how certain kinds of dance move from the margins to the mainstream.Banes begins by considering the act of dance criticism itself, exploring its modes, methods, and underlying assumptions and examining the work of other critics. She traces the development of contemporary dance from the early work of such influential figures as Merce Cunningham and George Balanchine to such contemporary choreographers as Molissa Fenley, Karole Armitage, and Michael Clark. She analyzes the contributions of the Judson Dance Theatre and the Workers' Dance League, the emergence of Latin postmodern dance in New York, and the impact of black jazz in Russia. In addition, Banes explores such untraditional performance modes as breakdancing and the ""drunk dancing"" of Fred Astaire.",270,"['Art', 'Music']",2 follower,6 review,23,0 (0%),2 (3%),15 (23%),16 (25%),30 (47%)

Out,Ronald Sukenick,3.62,34 rating,"January 1, 1973","Out is a novel of immense energy. Sukenick's characters flash into and out of presence; episodes impel themselves so strongly that they are self-obliterating. This is an experiment in narrative and language; at the same time it is an extremely accurate, persistently funny portrayal of the psychic overload we all reached at the end of the sixties. Sukenick engages the full range of contemporary fantasy -- revolution, conspiracy, pastoral nostalgia, Indian wisdom, demonic secret societies, and sexual extravaganza. These do not merely occur in the narrative but occupy it. Singly and in various rapid combinations, they add their manic energies to the book's acceleration. Out begins in New York City, in full urban congestion. Its first characters are moving across a ledge with sticks of dynamite in their mouths -- members of the total conspiracy. (""You're either a part of the plot or the counterplot. Everybody's got to be one or the other."") They move toward meets -- occasions when they'll bundle their individual dynamites together and blow something up. The central character begins the novel as an arranger of these meets, conspirator and novelist. The novel moves out of New York and across the country toward the Pacific. The first moves occur with narrative furniture and transitional cardboard boxes, but as the book gathers speed and distance, these fall away. Out moves across the white space of its own pages, as well as across the country.

However, it was these early stories that first earned her a reputation as a writer with ""the liveliest imagination and most delicate style of her time."" Influenced by Joyce, Proust, and the theories of William James, Bergson, and Freud, she strove to write a new fiction that emphasized the continuous flow of consciousness, time's passage as both a series of sequential moments and a longer flow of years and centuries, and the essential indefinability of character.Readers can discover these and other aspects of her influential style in the eight stories collected here, among them a delightful, feminist put-down of the male intellect in ""A Society"" and a brilliant and sensitive portrayal of nature in ""Kew Gardens."" Also included are ""An Unwritten Novel,"" ""The String Quartet,"" ""A Haunted House,"" ""Blue & Green,"" ""The Mark on the Wall,"" and the title story.In recent years, Woolf's fiction, feminism, and high-minded sensibilities have earned her an ever-growing audience of readers. This splendid collection offers those readers not only the inestimable pleasures of the stories themselves, but an excellent entrée into the larger body of Woolf's work.",155,"['Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Feminism', 'Literature', 'British Literature', '20th Century']",24.1k follower,432 review,"1,373",90 (2%),320 (9%),"1,001 (30%)","1,194 (36%)",695 (21%)
Collected Stories,William Faulkner,4.24,"7,668 rating","January 1, 1950","“A Bear Hunt,” “A Rose for Emily,” “Two Soldiers,” “Victory,” “The Brooch,” “Beyond”—these are among the forty-two stories that make up this magisterial collection by the writer who stands at the pinnacle of modern American fiction. Compressing an epic expanse of vision into narratives as hard and wounding as bullets, William Faulkner’s stories evoke the intimate textures of place, the deep strata of history and legend, and all the fear, brutality, and tenderness of which human beings are capable. These tales are set not only in Yoknapatawpha County but in Beverly Hills and in France during World War I; they are populated by such characters as the Faulknerian archetypes Flem Snopes and Quentin Compson (“A Justice”) as well as ordinary men and women who emerge in these pages so sharply and indelibly that they dwarf the protagonists of most novels.--back coverContains:Barn burning --Shingles for the Lord --The tall men --A bear hunt --Two soldiers --Shall not perish --A rose for Emily --Hair --Centaur in brass --Dry September --Death drag --Elly --Uncle Willy --Mule in the yard --That will be fine --That evening sun --Red leaves --A justice --A courtship --Lo! --Ad Astra --Victory --Crevasse --Turnabout --All the dead pilots --Wash --Honor --Dr. Martino --Fox hunt --Pennsylvania Station --Artist at home --The brooch --My Grandmother Millard --Golden land --There was a queen --Mountain victory --Beyond --Black music --The leg --Mistral --Divorce in Naples --Carcassonne.",900,"['Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'American', 'Southern Gothic', 'Southern']","9,238 follower",243 review,928,105 (1%),227 (2%),"1,006 (13%)","2,703 (35%)","3,627 (47%)"

In the unseasonable heat of a spring morning in 80 B.C., Gordianus the Finder is summoned to the house of Cicero, a young advocate staking his reputation on this case. The charge is patricide; the motive, a son's greed. The punishment, rooted deep in Roman tradition, is horrific beyond imagining.Gordianus's investigation takes him through the city's raucous, pungent streets and deep into urban Umbria, unraveling layers of deceit, twisted passions, and murderous desperation. From pompous, rouged nobles to wily slaves to citizens of seemingly simple virtue, the case becomes a political nightmare.

Each of the characters tries in a different way to keep their bearings in a world suddenly changed beyond recognition.

She kept a withering journal of her life, wrote letters, and left behind a trail needing only modern signposts. She was an integral part of a family firm of scholars and writers. But she could never seize the opportunities that a few other women of her age did.

Η νυχτερίδα,Στρατής Τσίρκας,4.47,443 rating,"January 1, 1965","Οι ""Ακυβέρνητες Πολιτείες"" απαρτίζονται από τρεις τόμους: ""Η λέσχη"" (1961), ""Αριάγνη"" (1962), ""Η νυχτερίδα"" (1965). Η δράση τοποθετείται αντίστοιχα στην Ιερουσαλήμ, στο Κάιρο, στην Αλεξάνδρεια. Ένα μυθιστόρημα που τιθασεύει αριστοτεχνικά μια χειμαρρώδη ιστορική ύλη, δίνοντας ανθρώπινη φωνή στο έπος και στο δράμα του Β΄ Παγκοσμίου Πολέμου, την ώρα που κρινόταν το μέλλον των λαών και παίχτηκε στα ζάρια η τύχη της Ελλάδας. Χάρη σε ποικίλες αναδρομές, η τριλογία ζωντανεύει και προγενέστερες περιόδους, από τον Μεσοπόλεμο, τον χλωρό παράδεισο της εφηβείας με τα πρώτα ερωτικά σκιρτήματα κάποιων ηρώων, ως την παλιά Αίγυπτο, ανακαλώντας μνήμες προγόνων. Το έργο κορυφώνεται με την εξέγερση του Στρατού και του Στόλου, το κίνημα του Απρίλη 1944 και τη δραματική καταστολή του, ενώ, με τον επίλογο του γ΄ τόμου, μεταφερόμαστε στη Θεσσαλονίκη μετά τον Εμφύλιο, το 1954, όπου ακούγεται ένα συγκλονιστικό ρέκβιεμ για τους χαμένους αγωνιστές.Ωστόσο, ο Τσίρκας δεν έγραψε χρονικό, αλλά έργο τέχνης. Ιστορική ακρίβεια και φαντασία σπάνια δένονται σ' ένα τόσο αρμονικό σύνολο. Κινώντας στιβαρά μεγάλους όγκους, καταγράφει ευαίσθητα τις απηχήσεις των γεγονότων στη συνείδηση και στις σχέσεις των ανθρώπων, πλάθοντας ολοζώντανες μορφές που θα μείνουν στο πάνθεον των μυθιστορηματικών ηρώων. Πολιτικές μηχανορραφίες, αχαλίνωτες φιλοδοξίες μέσα στη δίνη του πολέμου, αλλά και ωραία όνειρα και περίσσευμα ανθρωπιάς και γενναιότητας δίνουν το στίγμα των ""Ακυβέρνητων Πολιτειών"", όπου ο έρωτας, κυρίαρχος, τυλίγει και ξετυλίγει το νήμα μιας συναρπαστικής πλοκής. Παράλληλα, με την πολυφωνία της αφήγησης και άλλες νεωτερικές τεχνοτροπίες, ο συγγραφέας κατορθώνει να συγχωνεύσει τον μοντερνισμό με την παράδοση.
