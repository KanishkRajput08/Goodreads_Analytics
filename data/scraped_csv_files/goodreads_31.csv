Lila Mae Watson, the city’s first black female inspector and a devout Intuitionist with the highest accuracy rate in the department, is at the center of the turmoil. An elevator in a new municipal building has crashed on Lila Mae’s watch, fanning the flames of the Empiticist-Intuitionist feud and compelling Lila Mae to go underground to investigate. As she endeavors to clear her name, she becomes entangled in a web of intrigue that leads her to a secret that will change her life forever.A dead-serious and seriously funny feat of the imagination, The Intuitionist conjures a parallel universe in which latent ironies in matters of morality, politics, and race come to light, and stands as the celebrated debut of an important American writer.",255,34,16.6k follower,"['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Literary Fiction', 'African American', 'Novels', 'Fantasy']","1,714 review","2,922 (20%)","5,342 (37%)","4,374 (30%)","1,354 (9%)",359 (2%)

The Will to Power,Friedrich Nietzsche,4.06,"10,352 rating","January 1, 1901","Nietzsche’s notebooks, kept by him during his most productive years, offer a fascinating glimpse into the workshop and mind of a great thinker, and compare favorably with the notebooks of Gide and Kafka, Camus and Wittgenstein. The Will to Power, compiled from the notebooks, is one of the most famous books of the past hundred years, but few have studied it. Here is the first critical edition in any language.Down through the Nazi period The Will to Power, was often mistakenly considered to be Nietzche’s crowning systematic labor; since World War II it has frequently been denigrated. In fact, it represents a stunning selection from Nietzsche’s notebooks, in a topical arrangement that enables the reader to find what Nietzsche wrote on nihilism, art, morality, religion, the theory of knowledge, and whatever else interested him. But no previous edition—even in the original German—shows which notes Nietzsche utilized subsequently in his works, and which sections are not paralleled in the finished books. Nor has any previous edition furnished a commentary or index.Walter Kaufmann, in collaboration with R. J. Holilngdale, brings to this volume his unsurpassed skills as a Nietzsche translator and scholar. Professor Kaufmann has included an approximate date of each note. His running footnote commentary offers information needed to follow Nietzsche’s train of thought, and indicates, among other things, which notes were eventually superseded by later formulations. The comprehensive index serves to guide the reader to the extraordinary riches of this book.",575,"3,745",21.6k follower,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Psychology', 'Religion', 'Theory', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Psychology', 'Religion', 'Theory', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Psychology', 'Religion', 'Theory', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Psychology', 'Religion', 'Theory', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Psychology', 'Religion', 'Theory']",289 review,"4,178 (40%)","3,542 (34%)","1,930 (18%)",472 (4%),230 (2%)

The Book of Ebenezer Le Page,G.B. Edwards,4.26,"1,984 rating","January 1, 1981","Ebenezer Le Page, cantankerous, opinionated, and charming, is one of the most compelling literary creations of the late twentieth century. Eighty years old, Ebenezer has lived his whole life on the Channel Island of Guernsey, a stony speck of a place caught between the coasts of England and France yet a world apart from either. Ebenezer himself is fiercely independent, but as he reaches the end of his life he is determined to tell his own story and the stories of those he has known. He writes of family secrets and feuds, unforgettable friendships and friendships betrayed, love glimpsed and lost. The Book of Ebenezer Le Page is a beautifully detailed chronicle of a life, but it is equally an oblique reckoning with the traumas of the twentieth century, as Ebenezer recalls both the men lost to the Great War and the German Occupation of Guernsey during World War II, and looks with despair at the encroachments of commerce and tourism on his beloved island.G. B. Edwards labored in obscurity all his life and completed The Book of Ebenezer Le Page shortly before his death.

Dialectic of Enlightenment: Philosophical Fragments,Theodor W. Adorno,4.11,"7,370 rating","January 1, 1947","Dialectic of Enlightenment is undoubtedly the most influential publication of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. Written during the Second World War and circulated privately, it appeared in a printed edition in Amsterdam in 1947. ""What we had set out to do,"" the authors write in the Preface, ""was nothing less than to explain why humanity, instead of entering a truly human state, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism.""Yet the work goes far beyond a mere critique of contemporary events. Historically remote developments, indeed, the birth of Western history and of subjectivity itself out of the struggle against natural forces, as represented in myths, are connected in a wide arch to the most threatening experiences of the present. The book consists in five chapters, at first glance unconnected, together with a number of shorter notes. The various analyses concern such phenomena as the detachment of science from practical life, formalized morality, the manipulative nature of entertainment culture, and a paranoid behavioral structure, expressed in aggressive anti-Semitism, that marks the limits of enlightenment. The authors perceive a common element in these phenomena, the tendency toward self-destruction of the guiding criteria inherent in enlightenment thought from the beginning. Using historical analyses to elucidate the present, they show, against the background of a prehistory of subjectivity, why the National Socialist terror was not an aberration of modern history but was rooted deeply in the fundamental characteristics of Western civilization.Adorno and Horkheimer see the self-destruction of Western reason as grounded in a historical and fateful dialectic between the domination of external nature and society. They trace enlightenment, which split these spheres apart, back to its mythical roots. Enlightenment and myth, therefore, are not irreconcilable opposites, but dialectically mediated qualities of both real and intellectual life. ""Myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to mythology."" This paradox is the fundamental thesis of the book.This new translation, based on the text in the complete edition of the works of Max Horkheimer, contains textual variants, commentary upon them, and an editorial discussion of the position of this work in the development of Critical Theory.",304,508,"1,204 follower","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'History', 'German Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'History', 'German Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'History', 'German Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'History', 'German Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'History', 'German Literature']",344 review,"3,207 (43%)","2,401 (32%)","1,286 (17%)",322 (4%),154 (2%)

The Many-Coloured Land,Julian  May,4.07,"12,834 rating","January 1, 1981","In the year 2034, Theo Guderian, a French physicist, made an amusing but impractical discovery: the means to use a one-way, fixed-focus time warp that opened into a place in the Rhone River valley during the idyllic Pliocene Epoch, six million years ago. But, as time went on, a certain usefulness developed. The misfits and mavericks of the future—many of them brilliant people—began to seek this exit door to a mysterious past. In 2110, a particularly strange and interesting group was preparing to make the journey—a starship captain, a girl athlete, a paleontologist, a woman priest, and others who had reason to flee the technological perfection of twenty-second-century life.Thus begins this dazzling fantasy novel that invites comparisons with the work of J.R.R. Tolkien, Arthur C. Clarke, and Ursula Le Quin. It opens up a whole world of wonder, not in far-flung galaxies but in our own distant past on Earth—a world that will captivate not only science-fiction and fantasy fans but also those who enjoy literate thrillers.The group that passes through the time-portal finds an unforeseen strangeness on the other side. Far from being uninhabited, Pliocene Europe is the home of two warring races from another planet. There is the knightly race of the Tanu—handsome, arrogant, and possessing vast powers of psychokinesis and telepathy. And there is the outcast race of Firvulag—dwarfish, malevolent, and gifted with their own supernormal skills. Taken captive by the Tanu and transported through the primordial European landscape, the humans manage to break free, join in an uneasy alliance with the forest-dwelling Firvulag, and, finally, launch an attack against the Tanu city of light on the banks of a river that, eons later, would be called the Rhine.Myth and legend, wit and violence, speculative science and breathtaking imagination mingle in this romantic fantasy, which is the first volume in a series about the exile world.",415,86,551 follower,"['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Adventure']",593 review,"5,089 (39%)","4,554 (35%)","2,350 (18%)",635 (4%),206 (1%)
