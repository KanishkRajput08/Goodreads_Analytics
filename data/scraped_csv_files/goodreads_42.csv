La vera storia dell'ultimo re socialista,Roy  Lewis,3.48,80 rating,"January 1, 1990","«E se le cose fossero andate in un altro modo? Se in un momento cruciale avessero preso un corso diverso?». Domande che qualsiasi persona ragionevole si pone ogni volta che tocca quella strana, impalpabile materia che si chiama Storia. Roy Lewis l’ha affrontata in questo romanzo con la stessa sottile verve, con la stessa illuminante disinvoltura con cui aveva trattato la preistoria in Il più grande uomo scimmia del Pleistocene, anche qui usando il gioco per dare evidenza e plasticità a pensieri che vanno lontano. Così ha voluto seguire una vena del possibile, immettendo, per così dire, in un supercomputer «la vittoria del socialismo, anziché quella del capitalismo, nella rivoluzione che travolse l’Europa del 1848». Dopo lunga elaborazione, il computer ha prodotto questo teorema in forma di romanzo. Osserviamo i fatti: anzitutto la regina Vittoria non regna per più di mezzo secolo, bensì deve abdicare nel 1849 davanti alla rivolta dei cartisti (i socialisti inglesi). Ma che avviene dopo? Si stabilisce un regime socialista (ma senza abolire la monarchia, perché siamo pur sempre in Inghilterra). Di un socialismo relativamente mite e bucolico, preoccupato soprattutto di garantire il lavoro a tutti e di mantenere l’uguaglianza. Il risultato è un lento disastro. Soprattutto perché socialismo e tecnologia non vanno insieme. La tecnologia, che è la vera rivoluzione, scompagina continuamente i rapporti sociali – e questo i bravi e un po’ tonti socialisti non riescono a sopportarlo. Si preparano così le basi per una rivoluzione che abbatta il sistema. Ma che accadrà se complice di questa rivoluzione diventa «l’ultimo re socialista»? Ce lo racconterà lui stesso, e non sarà facile dimenticare il personaggio di questo gentile, amabile sovrano, che avrebbe senz’altro preferito insegnare matematica in qualche oscura università, e si ritrova invece, spinto dalla forza delle cose, a guidare una controrivoluzione per rovesciare il proprio regime – quindi per esautorare se stesso.

Tras un período retirado de la vida pública, en los años cincuenta retoma los viajes por el mundo a instancias de Josep Vergés, histórico editor de Pla en Destino, quien también le convencerá para editar su obra completa, 46 volúmenes que se abrirán en 1966 precisamente con este libro.

Manchester contends that even more than his leadership in combat, Churchill’s finest hour was the uphill battle against appeasement. As Parliament received with jeers and scorn his warnings against the growing Nazi threat, Churchill stood alone—only to be vindicated by history as a beacon of hope amid the gathering storm. Praise for The Last Lion: Alone   “Manchester has such control over a huge and moving narrative, such illumination of character . . . that he can claim the considerable achievement of having assembled enough powerful evidence to support Isaiah Berlin’s judgment of Churchill as ‘the largest human being of our time.’”—The New Yorker

Romance,Joseph Conrad,3.45,100 rating,"January 1, 1903","Joseph Conrad, born Jozef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski, (1857-1924) was a Polish-born novelist who spent most of his adult life in Britain. He is regarded as one of the greatest English novelists, which is even more notable because he did not learn to speak English well until he was in his 20s. He is recognized as a master prose stylist. Some of his works have a strain of romanticism, but more importantly he is recognized as an important forerunner of modernist literature. His narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many writers, including Ernest Hemingway, D.H. Lawrence and Graham Greene. Writing during the apogee of the British Empire, Conrad drew upon his experiences in the British Merchant Navy to create novels and short stories that reflected aspects of a world-wide empire while also plumbing the depths of the human soul. Amongst his best known works are Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900), Under Western Eyes (1911), Victory (1915) and The Rescue (1920).",426,"3,101","4,179 follower","['Novels', 'Classics', 'British Literature', 'Adventure', 'Fiction', 'Novels', 'Classics', 'British Literature', 'Adventure', 'Fiction', 'Novels', 'Classics', 'British Literature', 'Adventure', 'Fiction']",6 review,24 (24%),20 (20%),36 (36%),17 (17%),3 (3%)

Garrow,4.34,"2,182 rating","December 1, 1986","Winner of the Pulitzer Prize: The definitive biography of Martin Luther King Jr.  In this monumental account of the life of Martin Luther King Jr., professor and historian David Garrow traces King’s evolution from young pastor who spearheaded the 1955–56 bus boycott of Montgomery, Alabama, to inspirational leader of America’s civil rights movement. Based on extensive research and more than seven hundred interviews, with subjects including Andrew Young, Jesse Jackson, and Coretta Scott King, Garrow paints a multidimensional portrait of a charismatic figure driven by his strong moral obligation to lead—and of the toll this calling took on his life. Bearing the Cross provides a penetrating account of King’s spiritual development and his crucial role at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, whose protest campaigns in Birmingham and Selma, Alabama, led to enactment of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965.   This comprehensive yet intimate study reveals the deep sense of mission King felt to serve as an unrelenting crusader against prejudice, inequality, and violence, and his willingness to sacrifice his own life on behalf of his beliefs. Written more than twenty-five years ago, Bearing the Cross remains an unparalleled examination of the life of Martin Luther King Jr. and the legacy of the civil rights movement.",794,35,61 follower,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Race', 'American History', 'African American', 'Politics']",135 review,"1,164 (53%)",681 (31%),269 (12%),46 (2%),22 (1%)
Reflections from the North Country,Sigurd F.

In an account alive with anecdote and insight, Olson outlines the wilderness philosophy he developed while working as an outspoken advocate for the conservation of America's natural heritage.Based on speeches delivered at town meetings and government hearings, this book joins The Singing Wilderness and Listening Point as the core of Olson's work. Upon its initial publication in 1976, Reflections from the North Country, with Olson's unique combination of lyrical nature writing and activism, became an inspiration to the burgeoning environmental movement, selling over 46,000 copies in hardcover.In this wide-ranging work, Olson evokes the soaring grace of raven, osprey, and eagle, the call of the loon, and the song of the hermit thrush. He challenges the reader to loosen the grasp of technology and the rush of contemporary life and make room for a sense of wonder heightened by being in nature. From evolution to the meaning and power of solitude, Olson meditates on the human condition, offering eloquent testimony to the joys and truths he discovered in his beloved north-country wilderness.",192,36,64 follower,"['Nature', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Outdoors', 'Memoir', 'Environment', 'Conservation']",44 review,204 (44%),174 (38%),61 (13%),11 (2%),4 (<1%)

The city is occupied by Romanian troops after having undergone two brief social revolutions. The novel focuses on the plight of a young peasant woman who comes to work as a maid for the Vizys, a pathologically self-absorbed middle-class couple who are struggling to maintain their social standing amidst the ever-changing political climate. Pleased with Anna's almost robotic work ethic, Mrs. Vizy becomes obsessed with maintaining her servant's loyalty through psychological manipulation. A metaphor for the inhumanity of Hungary's precarious bourgeoisie, the novel follows Anna's victimization by her employers, her fellow servants and the Vizys' dissolute nephew as she struggles to achieve even the slightest emotional connection. Kosztolanyi's characters are ironic to the point of caricature, except Anna, whose inexplicable simple-mindedness limits the reader's sympathy for her.

Now, in Two or Three Things I Know for Sure, she takes a probing look at her family's history to give us a lyrical, complex memoir that explores how the gossip of one generation can become legends for the next.Illustrated with photographs from the author's personal collection, Two or Three Things I Know for Sure tells the story of the Gibson women -- sisters, cousins, daughters, and aunts -- and the men who loved them, often abused them, and, nonetheless, shared their destinies.
