Wolf Solent,John Cowper Powys,4.10,566 rating,"January 1, 1929","First published in 1929, John Cowper Powys's novel of Eros and ideas was compared with works by Shakespeare, Thomas Hardy, and D.H. Lawrence. Wolf Solent remains wholly unrivaled in its deft and risky balance of mysticism and social comedy, ecstatic contemplation of nature and unblinking observation of human folly and desire. Forsaking London for Ramsgard, Wolf Solent discovers a world of pagan splendor and medieval insularity, riddled by ancient scandals and resentments. And there this poetic young man meets two women—the sensuous beauty Gerda and the ethereal gamine Christie—who will become the sharers of his body and soul. ""A novelist of great, cumulative force and lyrical intensity. . . .

Mariette in Ecstasy,Ron Hansen,3.75,"2,805 rating","January 1, 1991","The highly acclaimed and provocatively rendered story of a young postulant's claim to divine possession and religious ecstasy.In 1906, a beautiful seventeen year old postulant enters the convent of the Sisters of the Crucifixion in upstate New York. When she begins to bleed from her hands, feet, and side, the entire community is thrown into turmoil. Is Mariette a cunning sham, or sexually hysterical, or does God stalk her like a pitiless lover? Mariette in Ecstasy is a stunning immersion into the society of a small convent at the turn of the century, where a mysterious and ultimately harrowing world lies beneath the lovely, placid surface of everyday life. With Mariette In Ecstasy, critically acclaimed author Ron Hansen again powerfully demonstrates his gift for brilliantly recreating time and place. As intriguing as The Name Of The Rose, as sensually hypnotic as Marguerite Duras' The Lover, this is an intimate portrait of a fascinating young woman in the grip of an intractable fate, and it raises provocative questions about the complex nature of passionate faith. Exquisitely crafted, Mariette in Ecstasy is a spellbinding novel that marks a new level of achievement in one of our most gifted writers.~ from 1991 hardcover dustjacket",180,56,233 follower,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Religion', 'Spirituality', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Catholic']",337 review,747 (26%),"1,001 (35%)",743 (26%),245 (8%),69 (2%)

But the Manifesto, for all its vitriol, is impossible to dismiss as just the rantings of a lesbian lunatic. In fact, the work has indisputable prescience, not only as a radical feminist analysis light-years ahead of its timepredicting artificial insemination, ATMs, a feminist uprising against under-representation in the artsbut also as a stunning testament to the rage of an abused and destitute woman.The focus of this edition is not on the nostalgic appeal of the work, but on Avital Ronell’s incisive introduction, “Deviant The Aims of Valerie Solanas.” Here is a reconsideration of Solanas’s infamous text in light of her social milieu, Derrida’s “The Ends of Man” (written in the same year), Judith Butler’s Excitable Speech , Nietzsche’s Ubermensch and notorious feminist icons from Medusa, Medea and Antigone, to Lizzie Borden, Lorenna Bobbit and Aileen Wournos, illuminating the evocative exuberance of Solanas’s dark tract.",96,6,161 follower,"['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Essays', 'Gender', 'Classics', 'Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Essays', 'Gender', 'Classics', 'Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Essays', 'Gender', 'Classics']","1,451 review","2,912 (31%)","2,866 (30%)","2,253 (24%)",843 (9%),481 (5%)

The Country Under My Skin: A Memoir of Love and War,Gioconda Belli,4.22,"2,953 rating","January 1, 2001","""A passionate, lyrical, tough-minded account of an extraordinary life in art, revolution, and love. It's a book to relish, to read and re-read. Unforgettable."" --Salmon RushdieAn electrifying memoir from the acclaimed Nicaraguan writer (“A wonderfully free and original talent”—Harold Pinter) and central figure in the Sandinista Revolution.Until her early twenties, Gioconda Belli inhabited an upper-class cocoon: sheltered from the poverty in Managua in a world of country clubs and debutante balls; educated abroad; early marriage and motherhood. But in 1970, everything changed.

As Preston shows, the unprecedented levels of brutality were burned into the American consciousness as never before by the revolutionary war reporting of Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, Herbert Matthews, Vincent Sheean, Louis Fischer, and many others.

Carl Haffners Liebe zum Unentschieden,Thomas Glavinic,3.99,217 rating,"January 1, 1998","Es gibt in der Welt der Schachspieler die Gruppe der Ewigen Kronprinzen, jener Schachspieler, die wenigstens einmal die Chance gehabt haben, den Weltmeistertitel zu erringen, denen es aber nie gelungen ist. Viele von Ihnen galten und gelten als zumindest ebenso starke Spieler wie die Weltmeister, die sie herausgefordert haben. Einige von Ihnen haben mit ihrem Scheitern einen tragischen Ruhm erworben, der an Bedeutung sicher dem des jeweiligen Weltmeisters gleichkommt. Einer von diesen tragischen Kronprinzen, vielleicht der tragischste überhaupt war Karl Schlechter. Er war das größte Talent der sogenannten Wiener Schachschule und spielte im Jahr 1910 sein denkwürdiges Match um den Titel des Schachweltmeisters gegen Emanuel Lasker. Lasker war nach Wilhelm Steinitz, der sich seit einem Wettkampf gegen Adolph Anderssen 1866 offiziell und weitgehend unwidersprochen Schach-Weltmeister nannte, erst der zweite Träger dieses Titels, nachdem er Steinitz 1894 in einem Match besiegen konnte. Damals war der Weltmeistertitel beinahe so etwas wie ein Privatbesitz (ähnliche Verhältnisse gibt es heute auch wieder), das heißt, daß der Weltmeister entschied, gegen wen und unter welchen Bedingungen er den Titel verteidigte. Lasker galt dabei als ein Muster an Vorsicht: Ihm wurde oft vorgeworfen, seinen Titel in den meisten Fällen nur gegen eigentlich zweitklassige Spieler verteidigt zu haben. Jedenfalls behielt Lasker seinen Weltmeistertitel 27 Jahre lang, bis er ihn, im Alter von 53 Jahren, halb freiwillig an den jungen, aufstrebenden José Raoul Capablanca verlor. Er verteidigte den Titel in dieser Zeit in sechs Wettkämpfen, von denen ihn nur ein einziger, der gegen Karl Schlechter, an den Rand einer Niederlage brachte. Lasker war 1910 immer noch auf der ganzen Höhe seiner Spielstärke: Er hatte noch im Jahr zuvor zusammen mit Rubinstein das starke St. Petersburger Turnier gewonnen. Schlechter andererseits war ohne jede Frage einer der stärksten Spieler seiner Zeit und würde im selben Jahr des Weltmeisterschaftkampfes noch das gut besetzte Hamburger Turnier gewinnen. Der Wettkampf zwischen Lasker und Schlechter war auf 10 Partien angesetzt; dem Weltmeister genügte damals wie heute ein Unentschieden im Gesamtergebnis, um seinen Titel behalten zu dürfen. Schlechter galt als überragender Verteidigungskünstler, der es seinem Gegner schwer machen würde, seinen Stil durchzusetzen. Und entsprechend war der Verlauf des Wettkampfes: Acht der zehn Partien endeten Remis; nur zwei Partei wurden entschieden. Schlechter gewann die fünfte, zugleich die letzte der in Wien gespielten Partien; Lasker die zehnte und letzte, in Berlin gespielte Partie des Wettkampfs und blieb so bei einem Endstand von 5 : 5 Weltmeister. Es ist viel um diese letzte Partie des Wettkampfes gerätselt worden. Schlechter hatte eine bessere Position erreicht, die ohne jede Frage zum Remis, vielleicht sogar zu einem zweiten Sieg hätte reichen müssen. Aber ganz entgegen seiner sonstigen, sehr vorsichtigen Spielweise, beginnt Schlechter plötzlich riskant zu spielen und die Partie zu öffnen. Man muß Lasker zugestehen, daß er diese einzige Chance, die ihm Schlechter während des Wettkampfs geboten hat, augenblicklich genutzt hat, um die Partie zu seinen Gunsten zu entscheiden. All dies ist der Stoff, aus dem Thomas Glavinic, selbst ein starker Schachspieler, seinen Roman gearbeitet hat. Er beschreibt die Umstände des Wettkampfes sehr detailliert und weitgehend historisch exakt und stellt dabei in den Mittelpunkt seiner Aufmerksamkeit seine Romanfigur Carl Haffner, die er mit den historischen Personen umgibt. Carl Haffner ist einerseits mit der Biographie Karl Schlechters ausgestattet, aber er ist andererseits eine erfundene Figur, die der Roman mit all ihren Gedanken, Ängstlichkeiten und Marotten erst erfindet, um sie jene Stelle des historischen Karl Schlechter vollständig ausfüllen zu lassen. Glavinic ist sich durchaus darüber im klaren, das er hier einen Drahtseilakt versucht, und es ist kein Wunder, daß die Schach-Fachpresse es nicht hat unterlassen können, die Erfindung der Figur Carl Haffner am historischen Gegenstück zu messen und das eine oder andere auszusetzen. Das scheint mir recht unangemessen zu sein: Wenn ein Autor schon absichtlich in ein sonst bemüht exakt gezeichnetes historisches Bild eine erfundene Figur hineinstellt, so sollte man ihm dann schon das Zugeständnis machen, diese erfundene Figur mit den Wesenszügen, Charaktermerkmalen und -schwächen auszustatten, die der Autor für seine Geschichte benötigt. Der Roman ist schlicht keine Biographie und will keine sein. Das Buch ist gut und lesbar geschrieben. Es konzentriert sich sehr auf die Empfindungen, Befürchtungen und Hoffnungen seines Titelhelden. Glavinic versteht es, auch dem nicht Schach spielenden Leser die Monomanie verständlich zu machen, die in nicht wenigen Fällen mit der absoluten Konzentration der großen Spieler auf ihr Spiel verbunden ist. Er zeigt die Vereinzelung seines Protagonisten, seine Hilflosigkeit im Alltag und den Wesenswandel, der mit ihm vorgeht, wenn er sich in sein Spiel vertieft. Er zeigt die Besessenheit Haffners, der schon als Jugendlicher Schule und Beruf vernachlässigt, einzig um seiner wirklichen Leidenschaft und seinem wahren Talent nachzugehen: dem Schachspiel. Er begleitet den Aufstieg des jungen Mannes zum größten Talent und zur Hoffnung der Wiener Schachschule, der deutschen Übermacht im Schach etwas entgegenstellen zu können. All dies erzählt Glavinic wie nebenbei, während im Zentrum des Romans jene Tage der zehn Weltmeisterschaftspartien stehen. Und Glavinic hat den nötigen Abstand zu der Sache, die er beschreibt: Mit Hilfe der Figur der jungen Journalistin Anna Feiertanz -- bei der ich neugierig wäre, ob es für sie ein historisches Vorbild im Umfeld Schlechters gegeben hat -- karikiert Glavinic das ""äußerst bedeutende"" Treiben der Schachmeister und ihres Anhangs. Sie behält den Blick von Außen auf das Geschehen und begleitet es hier und da mit ihren ironischen und spöttischen Kommentaren. Auch Thomas Glavinic löst letztendlich das Rätsel um die zehnte Partie nicht, denn schließlich ist es bei ihm Carl Haffner, der diesen Wettkampf spielt und verliert. Aber Glavinic macht klar, welche Spannungen und Widersprüche dabei vielleicht im Spiel gewesen sein könnten. Ein gelungenes und gut lesbares psychologisches Gedankenexperiment, das nicht nur für Schachspieler von Interesse sein dürfte. --Marius Fränzel ",208,19,125 follower,"['Chess', 'Fiction', 'German Literature']",11 review,62 (28%),105 (48%),38 (17%),10 (4%),2 (<1%)

Su verdadero nombre fue Nguyen Sinh Coong, aunque en la clandestinidad usó apodos para eludir la persecución policial. Tras la Primera Guerra Mundial, y bajo el nombre de Nguyen Ai Quoc, participa en actividades radicales y colabora en la fundación del Partido Comunista Francés. Se traslada a Moscú para recibir formación y, a finales de 1924, es enviado a Guangdong (China), donde formó la Liga de la Juventud Revolucionaria. Tuvo que dejar China, tras ser acusado por las autoridades locales de protagonizar actividades comunistas, aunque en 1930 regresó para fundar el Partido Comunista Indochino (PCI). En junio de 1931 le encarcelaron hasta 1933. Cuando en 1941 Japón ocupó Vietnam, mantuvo contactos con los líderes del PCI y ayudó a fundar un nuevo movimiento de independencia dominado por los comunistas, denominado Vietminh, que combatió a los japoneses. Fue entonces cuando aceptó el nombre de Ho Chi Minh. En agosto de 1945, tras la rendición de Japón, el Vietminh tomó el poder y proclamó la República Democrática de Vietnam en Hanoi, siendo Ho Chi Minh nombrado su presidente. Los franceses no querían conceder la independencia a sus súbditos coloniales, y durante ocho años las guerrillas del Vietminh combatieron a las tropas francesas, derrotándolas finalmente en la decisiva batalla de Dien Bien Phu en 1954. Sin embargo no obtuvo una victoria completa. La Conferencia de Ginebra dividió el país, asignándose el Norte al Vietminh, a pesar de las protestas de Ho Chi Minh, que pretendía mantener unificado a Vietnam. En la República Democrática de Vietnam, de la cual Ho seguía siendo presidente, se ocupó de crear un régimen comunista en Vietnam del Norte, sin embargo, a principios de la década de 1960, se inició el conflicto con la República de Vietnam, donde las guerrillas comunistas (Vietcong) organizaron un movimiento de insurgencia contra el régimen survietnamita apoyado por Estados Unidos.

This may confuse today's readers who do not understand the changes in the political spectrum, but for Orwell, this was a natural choice.In the 1930s, commissioned by a left-wing book club, Orwell went to the industrial areas of northern England to investigate and record the real situation of the working class. Orwell did more than just investigate; he went down to the deepest part of the mine, lived in dilapidated and filthy workers' houses, and used the tip of his pen to vividly reveal every aspect of the coal miners' lives. Reading today, 80 years later, Still shockingly true. The despair and poverty conveyed by this picture have a terrifying power that transcends time and national boundaries. At the same time, the Road to Wigan Pier is also Orwell's road to socialism as he examines his own inner self. Born in the British middle class, he recalled how he gradually began to doubt and then hate the strict class barriers that divided British society at that time. Because in his mind, socialism ultimately means only one concept: ""justice and freedom.""",215,"1,187",43.8k follower,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Classics', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'Literature', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Classics', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'Literature', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Classics', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'Literature', 'Biography']","1,896 review","6,641 (27%)","10,343 (43%)","5,737 (23%)","1,055 (4%)",236 (<1%)

Instead, they are battered to death by a thief with a chunk of granite. Their corpses lie undiscovered and rotting for a week, prey to sand crabs, flies, and gulls. Yet there remains something touching about the scene, with Joseph's hand curving lightly around his wife's leg, ""quietly resting; flesh on flesh; dead, but not departed yet.""""Their bodies had expired, but anyone could tell--just look at them--that Joseph and Celice were still devoted. For while his hand was touching her, curved round her shin, the couple seemed to have achieved that peace the world denies, a period of grace, defying even murder. Anyone who found them there, so wickedly disfigured, would nevertheless be bound to see that something of their love had survived the death of cells. The corpses were surrendered to the weather and the earth, but they were still a man and wife, quietly resting; flesh on flesh; dead, but not departed yet.""From that moment forward, Being Dead becomes less about murder and more about death.

As the narrative moves backward, we see Celice and Joseph make the small decisions about their day that will lead them inexorably towards their own deaths.

La generazione è quella, legata all’ideologia marxista, che perse la guerra civile e conobbe le deportazioni e le torture. L’uomo è un poeta di grande statura morale che, pur segnato dall’amarezza dell’incomprensione, culminata nell’espulsione dal partito comunista, non rinnegò mai la sua fede politica. Un poeta custode della memoria, che individuò nella guerra civile l’origine della disgregazione di una comunità sempre più minata dall’inganno e dall’ignavia. E poiché nella scrittura di Anaghnostakis il collettivo non è mai scisso dall’individuale, la sua è anche un’analisi esistenziale dell’uomo contemporaneo, condotta in uno stile diretto e quasi prosastico. Con il tempo, si acuì la sfiducia del poeta nella parola, ritenuta inadeguata a rispecchiare l’essenza e la “sostanza delle cose”. L’unica strada percorribile gli sembrò, quindi, quella del silenzio, quasi profetizzata negli anni “Verrò un giorno, nudo d’amore e di odio/ Inflessibile e inesorabile, con il silenzio come guida e compagno”. Una decisione sofferta, a cui Anaghnostakis si attenne nell’ultima parte della sua vita.",186,24,15 follower,"['Poetry', 'Greece', 'Poetry', 'Greece', 'Poetry', 'Greece']",17 review,144 (64%),55 (24%),24 (10%),2 (<1%),0 (0%)

The science of secrecy: The secret history of codes and codebreaking,Simon Singh,4.24,204 rating,"January 1, 1999","A TV tie-in edition of ""The Code Book"" filmed as a prime-time five-part Channel 4 series on the history of codes and code-breaking and presented by the author. This book, which accompanies the major Channel 4 series, brings to life the hidden history of codes and code breaking. Since the birth of writing, there has also been the need for secrecy. The story of codes is the story of the brilliant men and women who used mathematics, linguistics, machines, computers, gut instinct, logic and detective work to encrypt and break these secrect messages and the effect their work has had on history. In each episode of ""The Science of Secrecy"" Simon Singh tells us a fascinating story from the history of how the course of Crimean War was changed by the cracking of ""unbreakable"" Vigenere code; how the well-timed cracking of a single encoded telegram altered the course of World War I or how the mysteries of the Rosetta stone were revealed. The programme, and book, also investigates present day concerns about privacy on the internet and public key cryptography and looks to the future and the possibilities that quantum computing will radically change the science of secrecy in the 21st century.",240,42,"1,401 follower","['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'History', 'Popular Science', 'Engineering']",9 review,96 (47%),69 (33%),33 (16%),3 (1%),3 (1%)

About the Author Vladimir Ilich Lenin (1870-1924) was the founder of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), inspirer and leader of Bolshevik Revolution (1917), and the architect, builder, and first head (1917-24) of the Soviet State. He was the founder of the organization known as Comintern (Communist International) and the posthumous source of ""Leninism,"" the doctrine codified and conjoined with Marx's works by Lenin's successors to form Marxism-Leninism, which became the Communist worldview. If the Bolshevik Revolution is - as some people have called it - the most significant political event of the 20th century, then Lenin must for good or ill be regarded as the century's most significant political leader. Not only in the scholarly circles of the former Soviet Union but even among many non-Communist scholars, he has been regarded as the greatest revolutionary leader and revolutionary statesman in history, as well as the greatest revolutionary thinker since Marx.",108,"1,799","1,364 follower","['Politics', 'Theory', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'History', 'Lenin', 'Russia']",167 review,"1,194 (50%)",680 (28%),312 (13%),114 (4%),86 (3%)

The book & later film made a major contribution to awareness, outside anthropological & archeological communities, of both the island & the statues. Much of his evidence has now been refuted by archeologists. His methods have been criticised. Paul Bahn wrote: ""he relied on the selective use of evidence, which resulted in a misleading conclusion"". Heyerdahl is most controversially associated with an attempt to revive the theory that the islanders' stone carving technology came from S. America. He argued that as well as being settled by Polynesians, Easter Island was settled by people from Peru, an area described as ""more culturally developed"". ""Aku-aku"" refers to moving a tall, flat bottomed object by swiveling it alternatively on its corners in a walking fashion. Heyerdahl theorised the Easter Island Moai (statues) were moved in this fashion, & tested this on a small Moai--tho the test was abandoned after the Moai's base was damaged. He also asserts that for the islanders, Aku Aku means a ""spiritual guide."" Heyerdahl compared the highest quality stonework on the island to pre-Columbian Amerindian stonework such as at Tihuanaco. Seemingly unaware of Polynesian stoneworking traditions such as the Marae he said of Ahu Vinapu's retaining wall ""No Polynesian fisherman would have been capable of conceiving, much less building such a wall"". However Alfred Metraux had already pointed out that the rubble filled Rapanui walls were of a fundamentally different design to those of the Inca. Heyerdahl claimed a S. American origin for some Easter Island plants including the Totora reeds in the islands' three crater lakes which are now recognised as a separate species to the ones in Lake Titicaca.
