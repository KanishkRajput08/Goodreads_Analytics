The Royal Physician's Visit,Per Olov Enquist,3.82,"4,134 rating","January 1, 1999","An international sensation, The Royal Physician's Visit magnificently recasts the dramatic era of Danish history when Johann Friedrich Struensee -- court physician to mad young King Christian -- stepped through an aperture in history and became the holder of absolute power in Denmark. His is a gripping tale of power, sex, love, and the life of the mind, and it is superbly rendered here by one of Sweden's most acclaimed writers. A charismatic German doctor and brilliant intellectual, Struensee used his influence to introduce hundreds of reforms in Denmark in the 1760s. He had a tender and erotic affair with Queen Caroline Mathilde, who was unsatisfied by her unstable, childlike husband. Yet Struensee lacked the subtlety of a skilled politician and the cunning to choose enemies wisely; these flaws proved fatal, and would eventually lead to his tragic demise.",412,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Denmark', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Swedish Literature', 'Sweden', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Denmark', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Swedish Literature', 'Sweden', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Denmark', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Swedish Literature', 'Sweden']",157 follower,371 review,88,68 (1%),273 (6%),"1,028 (24%)","1,718 (41%)","1,047 (25%)"

Ants at Work: How an Insect Society is Organized,Deborah M. Gordon,3.75,203 rating,"October 6, 1999","Individual ants manage their incredibly complex colonies with no one in charge―how do they do it? Ants have long been regarded as the most interesting of the social insects. With their queens and celibate workers, these intriguing creatures have captured the imaginations of scientists and children alike for generations. Yet until now, no one had studied intensely the life cycle of the ant colony as a whole. An ant colony has a life cycle of about fifteen years―it is born, matures, and dies. But the individual ants that inhabit the colony live only one year. So how does this system of tunnels and caves in the dirt become so much more than the sum of its parts?Leading ant researcher Deborah Gordon takes the reader to the Arizona desert to explore this question.

The Four Graces,D.E. Stevenson,3.98,"1,658 rating","January 1, 1946","“The Four Graces” is a sly, enjoyable love letter to life in a small English town. Yes, it pokes fun at as much as it endorses, but this book makes you think that setting up in a vicarage with three sisters and the occasional gentleman caller is just the kind of life to have. There are really four Grace sisters, but we hardly see Addie, the youngest, who is in the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force and hardly ever at home. The focus is mainly on the three Liz, the lively beauty of the family, Sal, whose quick wit makes her more than just an ex-invalid, and Tilly, sweet, shy, musical, who wants to know why everything had to go up and change. There’s World War II, of course, but that’s not quite what Tilly means. There’s also the disagreeable Aunt Rona, who drops in for a visit after London is bombed and quite overstays her welcome. And there’s the gentleman callers William Single, the Roman history expert, and Captain Roderick Herd, who has clear intentions that end up more than a bit muddled. In fact, the whole book is a bit muddled – but in a good way. There’s just so much going on that you’re never bored. If you’re not laughing at Aunt Rona, you’re smiling over the simple yet kindhearted townsfolk, unless you’re wondering how Mrs. Chevis-Green and Miss Bodkin will ever patch up their misunderstanding. And if the town isn’t being spotlighted, the Grace family certainly is. Intelligent, observant Sal was my favorite, but I also liked Tilly and her practical outlook. --E.J.

Ingenious Pain : A Novel,Andrew  Miller,3.71,"1,822 rating","January 1, 1997","""What does the world need most--a good, ordinary man, or one who is outstanding, albeit with a heart of ice?"" This is the question at the heart of Andrew Miller's first novel, Ingenious Pain, a book set during the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment. The outstanding man in question is James Dyer, an English freak of nature who, since birth, has been impervious to physical pain. Not only does he feel no pain, but he recovers from all injuries in record time. By turns a shill for a quack pain- reliever at county fairs, an object of study by a wealthy collector of human oddities, and, eventually, a surgeon, James Dyer--and through him the reader--gains exposure to a panoply of 18th-century philosophical thought, medical practice, historic events, and larger-than-life rogues and heroes, both fictional and real.  As a surgeon, James Dyer excels, and his inability to feel--whether physical pain himself or empathy for others--seems only to enhance his skill with a knife. James slices and dices and cures without a scintilla of compassion while his reputation grows, until at last he arrives in Russia and the mystery of his unusual quality is resolved. Miller navigates his complicated story and exotic locales with unswerving confidence, bolstered, no doubt, by thorough research. James Dyer is not a character who invites love, but his adventures make for intelligent, deeply pleasurable reading.",337,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Medicine', 'Literary Fiction']",329 follower,167 review,15,39 (2%),141 (7%),520 (28%),733 (40%),389 (21%)

In 1971, at the height of the Vietnam War and at a time of great political and social instability, two of the world's leading intellectuals, Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault, were invited by Dutch philosopher Fons Edlers to debate an age-old question: is there such a thing as ""innate"" human nature independent of our experiences and external influences? The resulting dialogue is one of the most original, provocative, and spontaneous exchanges to have occurred between contemporary philosophers, and above all serves as a concise introduction to their basic theories.

In this diagram of his life, Benjamin focuses not on persons or events but on places and things, all seen from the perspective of a child--a collector, flaneur, and allegorist in one.This book is also one of Benjamin's great city texts, bringing to life the cocoon of his childhood--the parks, streets, schoolrooms, and interiors of an emerging metropolis.

The Napping House,Audrey Wood,4.27,"46,300 rating","January 1, 1984","Everyone knows the cumulative rhyme “This Is the House That Jack Built,” but The Napping House (1984) is close on its heels in the race for “And on that granny / there is a child / a dreaming child / on a snoring granny / on a cozy bed / in a napping house, / where everyone is sleeping.” Included in the napping house menagerie is a dozing dog, a snoozing cat, a slumbering mouse, and a wakeful flea who ends up toppling the whole sleep heap with one chomp! Don Wood’s delightfully detailed comical illustrations are bathed in moonlight blues until the sun comes up, then all is color and rainbows and a very awake household.

The Waiting Years,Fumiko Enchi,3.95,"2,439 rating","January 1, 1957","The beautiful, immature girl whom she took home to her husband was a maid only in name. Tomo's real mission had been to find him a mistress. Nor did her secret humiliation end there. The web that his insatiable lust spun about him soon trapped another young woman, and another ... and therelationships between the women thus caught were to form, over the years, a subtle, shifting pattern in which they all played a part. There was Suga, the innocent, introspective girl from a respectable but impoverished family; the outgoing, cheerful, almost boyish Yumi; the flirtatious, seductiveMiya, who soon found her father-in-law more dependable as a man than his brutish son.... And at the center, rejected yet dominating them all, the near tragic figure of the wife Tomo, whose passionate heart was always, until that final day, held in check by an old-fashioned code.In a series of colorful, unforgettable scenes, Enchi brilliantly handles the human interplay within the ill-fated Shirakawa family. Japan's leading woman novelist and a member of the prestigious Art Academy, she combines a graceful, evocative style that consciously echoes the Tale of Genji with keeninsight and an impressive ability to develop her characters over a long period of time. Her work is rooted deep in the female psychology, and it is her women above all-so clearly differentiated yet all so utterly feminine-who live in the memory. With The Waiting Years , a new and important literaryfigure makes her debut in the Western world.",204,"['Japan', 'Fiction', 'Japanese Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Asia', 'Historical', 'Japan', 'Fiction', 'Japanese Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Asia', 'Historical', 'Japan', 'Fiction', 'Japanese Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Asia', 'Historical']",171 follower,291 review,56,19 (<1%),121 (4%),542 (22%),"1,030 (42%)",727 (29%)
The Motion of Light in Water: Sex and Science Fiction Writing in the East Village,Samuel R. Delany,4.32,"1,111 rating","March 1, 1988","Born in New York City's black ghetto Harlem at the start of World War II, Samuel R. Delany married white poet Marilyn Hacker right out of high school. The interracial couple moved into the city's new bohemian quarter, the Lower East Side, in summer 1961. Through the decade's opening years, new art, new sexual practices, new music, and new political awareness burgeoned among the crowded streets and cheap railroad apartments. Beautifully, vividly, insightfully, Delany calls up this era of exploration and adventure as he details his development as a black gay writer in an open marriage, with tertiary walk-ons by Bob Dylan, Stokely Carmichael, W. H. Auden, and James Baldwin, and a panoply of brilliantly drawn secondary characters.Winner of the 1989 Hugo Award for Non-fictionSamuel R. Delany is the author of numerous science fiction books including Dhalgren, other fiction including The Mad Man, as well as the best-selling nonfiction study Times Square Red, Times Square Blue. He lives in New York City and teaches at Temple University. The Lambda Book Report chose Delany as one of the fifty most significant men and women of the past hundred years to change our concept of gayness, and he is a recipient of the William Whitehead Memorial Award for a lifetime's contribution to lesbian and gay literature.",584,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Gay', 'Writing']","1,996 follower",130 review,276,9 (<1%),32 (2%),146 (13%),336 (30%),588 (52%)
The Archaeology of Knowledge and The Discourse on Language,Michel Foucault,4.12,"7,038 rating","March 27, 1969","Librarian note: an alternate cover for this edition can be found here.Madness, sexuality, power, knowledge—are these facts of life or simply parts of speech? In a series of works of astonishing brilliance, historian Michel Foucault excavated the hidden assumptions that govern the way we live and the way we think. The Archaeology of Knowledge begins at the level of “things aid” and moves quickly to illuminate the connections between knowledge, language, and action in a style at once profound and personal. A summing up of Foucault’s own methodological assumptions, this book is also a first step toward a genealogy of the way we live now. Challenging, at times infuriating, it is an absolutely indispensable guide to one of the most innovative thinkers of our time.",256,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'History', 'Sociology', 'Academic', 'Language', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'History', 'Sociology', 'Academic', 'Language', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'History', 'Sociology', 'Academic', 'Language']","5,527 follower",210 review,671,106 (1%),315 (4%),"1,219 (17%)","2,398 (34%)","3,000 (42%)"
Sun & Steel,Yukio Mishima,3.90,"5,333 rating","January 1, 1968","In this fascinating document, one of Japan's best known-and controversial-writers created what might be termed a new literary form. It is new because it combines elements of many existing types of writing, yet in the end fits into none of them.At one level, it may be read as an account of how a puny, bookish boy discovered the importance of his own physical being; the ""sun and steel"" of the title are themselves symbols respectively of the cult of the open air and the weights used in bodybuilding. At another level, it is a discussion by a major novelist of the relation between action and art, and his own highly polished art in particular. More personally, it is an account of one individual's search for identity and self-integration. Or again, the work could be seen as a demonstration of how an intensely individual preoccupation can be developed into a profound philosophy of life.All these elements are woven together by Mishima's complex yet polished and supple style. The confession and the self-analysis, the philosophy and the poetry combine in the end to create something that is in itself perfect and self-sufficient. It is a piece of literature that is as carefully fashioned as Mishima's novels, and at the same time provides an indispensable key to the understanding of them as art.The road Mishima took to salvation is a highly personal one. Yet here, ultimately, one detects the unmistakable tones of a self transcending the particular and attaining to a poetic vision of the universal. The book is therefore a moving document, and is highly significant as a pointer to the future development of one of the most interesting novelists of modern times.",108,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Japan', 'Japanese Literature', 'Biography', 'Literature', 'Essays', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Japan', 'Japanese Literature', 'Biography', 'Literature', 'Essays', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Japan', 'Japanese Literature', 'Biography', 'Literature', 'Essays']","7,424 follower",606 review,433,81 (1%),353 (6%),"1,248 (23%)","1,976 (37%)","1,675 (31%)"
