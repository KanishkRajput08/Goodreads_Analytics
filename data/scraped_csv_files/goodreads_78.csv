Seeker's Mask,P.C. Hodgell,4.24,929 rating,"January 1, 1994","Jame has found and been reunited with her ten year older twin brother Tori. Now all she has to do is find a place for herself among the Kencyrs that are following her brother. This is not quite as easy as it sounds. For, if you remember, Jame has not grown up in the normal Kencyr lifestyle. When she is placed in the Women's Halls and is expected to change and become a normal quiet Kencyr lady, it is the Women's Halls that undergo the changes. For when you have Shadow Guild Assassins, ghosts, strange beings, and other characters from your past after you, it is rather difficult not to want a weapon, instead of a sewing needle, in your hand.

Someone powerful and clever who could help her rout the unscrupulous thieves who were using her beloved caves to hide their loot.

Dubbed the Beast of Blackthorne Hall for his scarred face and lecherous past, Gideon was strong and fierce and notoriously menacing. Yet Harriet could not find it in her heart to fear him. For in his tawny gaze she sensed a savage pain she longed to soothe . . . and a searing passion she yearned to answer.

Eclipse of the Sun,Michael D. O'Brien,4.43,761 rating,"December 1, 1997","In this fast-paced, reflective novel, (the third in a trilogy following Strangers and Sojourners and Plague Journal) Michael O'Brien presents the dramatic tale of a family that finds itself in the path of a totalitarian government. Set in the near future, the story describes the rise of a police state in North America in which every level of society is infected with propaganda, confusion and disinformation. Few people are equipped to recognize what is happening because the culture of the Western world has been deformed by a widespread undermining of moral absolutes. Against this background, the Delaney family of Swiftcreek, British Columbia, is struck a severe blow when the father of the family, the editor of a small newspaper which dares to speak the truth, is arrested by the dreaded Office of Internal Security. His older children flee into the forest of the northern interior, accompanied by their great-grandfather and an elderly priest, Father Andrei. Their little brother Arrow also becomes a fugitive as the government seeks to remove any witnesses, and eradicate all evidence of its ultimate goals. As O'Brien draws together the several strands of the story into a frightening yet moving climax, he explores the heart of growing darkness in North America, examining events which have already occurred. The reader will take away from this disturbing book a number of urgent questions: Are we living in the decisive moment of history? How dire is our situation? Do we live in pessimistic dread, or a Christian realism founded on hope? This is a tale about the victory of the weak over the powerful, courage over terror, good over evil, and, above all, the triumph of love.",857,40,634 follower,"['Fiction', 'Catholic', 'Christian Fiction', 'Christian', 'Religion', 'Spirituality', 'Christianity']",54 review,452 (59%),215 (28%),71 (9%),19 (2%),4 (<1%)

Hot Sour Salty Sweet: A Culinary Journey Through Southeast Asia,Jeffrey Alford,4.15,"1,873 rating","October 2, 2000","Luminous at dawn and dusk, the Mekong is a river road, a vibrant artery that defines a vast and fascinating region. Here, along the world's tenth largest river, which rises in Tibet and joins the sea in Vietnam, traditions mingle and exquisite food prevails. Award-winning authors Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid followed the river south, as it flows through the mountain gorges of southern China, to Burma and into Laos and Thailand. For a while the right bank of the river is in Thailand, but then it becomes solely Lao on its way to Cambodia. Only after three thousand miles does it finally enter Vietnam and then the South China Sea.It was during their travels that Alford and Duguid—who ate traditional foods in villages and small towns and learned techniques and ingredients from cooks and market vendors—came to realize that the local cuisines, like those of the Mediterranean, share a distinctive culinary approach: Each cuisine balances, with grace and style, the regional flavor quartet of hot, sour, salty, and sweet. This book, aptly titled, is the result of their journeys.Like Alford and Duguid's two previous works, Flatbreads and Flavors (""a certifiable publishing event"" —Vogue) and Seductions of Rice (""simply stunning""—The New York Times), this book is a glorious combination of travel and taste, presenting enticing recipes in ""an odyssey rich in travel anecdote"" (National Geographic Traveler).The book's more than 175 recipes for spicy salsas, welcoming soups, grilled meat salads, and exotic desserts are accompanied by evocative stories about places and people. The recipes and stories are gorgeously illustrated throughout with more than 150 full-color food and travel photographs.In each chapter, from Salsas to Street Foods, Noodles to Desserts, dishes from different cuisines within the region appear side by side: A hearty Lao chicken soup is next to a Vietnamese ginger-chicken soup; a Thai vegetable stir-fry comes after spicy stir-fried potatoes from southwest China.The book invites a flexible approach to cooking and eating, for dishes from different places can be happily served and eaten together: Thai Grilled Chicken with Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce pairs beautifully with Vietnamese Green Papaya Salad and Lao sticky rice.North Americans have come to love Southeast Asian food for its bright, fresh flavors. But beyond the dishes themselves, one of the most attractive aspects of Southeast Asian food is the life that surrounds it. In Southeast Asia, people eat for joy. The palate is wildly eclectic, proudly unrestrained. In Hot, Sour, Salty, Sweet, at last this great culinary region is celebrated with all the passion, color, and life that it deserves.",346,11,15 follower,"['Cookbooks', 'Food', 'Cooking', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Asian Literature', 'Asia', 'Cookbooks', 'Food', 'Cooking', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Asian Literature', 'Asia', 'Cookbooks', 'Food', 'Cooking', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Asian Literature', 'Asia']",47 review,871 (46%),574 (30%),310 (16%),72 (3%),46 (2%)

The Melancholy of Resistance,László Krasznahorkai,4.16,"4,339 rating","January 1, 1989","A powerful, surreal novel, in the tradition of Gogol, about the chaotic events surrounding the arrival of a circus in a small Hungarian town. The Melancholy of Resistance, László Krasznahorkai's magisterial novel, depicts a chain of mysterious events in a small Hungarian town. A circus, promising to display the stuffed body of the largest whale in the world, arrives in the dead of winter, prompting bizarre rumours. Word spreads that the circus folk have a sinister purpose in mind, and the frightened citizens cling to any manifestation of order they can find - music, cosmology, fascism. The novel's characters are unforgettable: the evil Mrs. Eszter, plotting her takeover of the town; her weakling husband; and Valuska, our hapless hero with his head in the clouds, who is the tender center of the book, the only pure and noble soul to be found. Compact, powerful and intense, The Melancholy of Resistance, as its enormously gifted translator George Szirtes puts it, ""is a slow lava flow of narrative, a vast black river of type.""

The End of Science: Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age,John Horgan,3.58,599 rating,"January 1, 1996","As staff writer for Scientific American, John Horgan has a window on contemporary science unsurpassed in all the world. Who else routinely interviews the likes of Lynn Margulis, Roger Penrose, Francis Crick, Richard Dawkins, Freeman Dyson, Murray Gell-Mann, Stephen Jay Gould, Stephen Hawking, Thomas Kuhn, Chris Langton, Karl Popper, Stephen Weinberg, and E.O. Wilson, with the freedom to probe their innermost thoughts?In The End Of Science, Horgan displays his genius for getting these larger-than-life figures to be simply human, and scientists, he writes, ”are rarely so human...so at ther mercy of their fears and desires, as when they are confronting the limits of knowledge.”This is the secret fear that Horgan pursues throughout this remarkable Have the big questions all been answered? Has all the knowledge worth pursuing become known? Will there be a final ”theory of everything” that signals the end? Is the age of great discoverers behind us? Is science today reduced to mere puzzle solving and adding detains to existing theories?Horgan extracts surprisingly candid answers to there and other delicate questions as he discusses God, Star Trek, superstrings, quarks, plectics, consciousness, Neural Darwinism, Marx's view of progress, Kuhn's view of revolutions, cellular automata, robots, and the Omega Point, with Fred Hoyle, Noam Chomsky, John Wheeler, Clifford Geertz, and dozens of other eminent scholars. The resulting narrative will both infuriate and delight as it mindles Horgan's smart, contrarian argument for ”endism” with a witty, thoughtful, even profound overview of the entire scientific enterprise.Scientists have always set themselves apart from other scholars in the belief that they do not construct the truth, they discover it. Their work is not interpretation but simple revelation of what exists in the empirical universe. But science itself keeps imposing limits on its own power. Special relativity prohibits the transmission of matter or information as speeds faster than that of light; quantum mechanics dictates uncertainty; and chaos theory confirms the impossibility of complete prediction. Meanwhile, the very idea of scientific rationality is under fire from Neo-Luddites, animal-rights acitivists, religious fundamentalists, and New Agers alike.As Horgan makes clear, perhaps the greatest threat to science may come from losing its special place in the hierarchy of disciplines, being reduced to something more akin to literaty criticism as more and more theoreticians engage in the theory twiddling he calls ”ironic science.” Still, while Horgan offers his critique, grounded in the thinking of the world's leading researchers, he offers homage too. If science is ending, he maintains, it is only because it has done its work so well.",320,42,52 follower,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'History Of Science', 'Popular Science', 'History']",56 review,126 (21%),215 (35%),167 (27%),65 (10%),26 (4%)

O aşez alături de mărturisirile unor Panait Istrati, Arthur Koestler, Aleksandr Soljeniţîn, Varlam Şalamov, Margarete Buber-Neumann, Whittaker Chambers şi Ignazio Silone. Comunismul a urmărit distrugerea omului interior, spune Wat. În cazul său, eşecul acestui proiect a fost total. Omul interior a învins.“ (Vladimir TISMĂNEANU)„Publicată la câţiva ani după moartea lui Wat, această remarcabilă transcriere a memoriilor sale înregistrate înflăcărează imaginaţia. Asemenea lui Dostoievski şi Soljeniţîn, Wat îşi evocă viaţa de deţinut politic cu o precizie dureroasă, împletindu-şi amintirile cu portrete pline de compasiune sau comice ale tovarăşilor săi de detenţie şi ale gardienilor. Dar geniul lui Wat se află dincolo de evocarea remarcabilă a locurilor şi de portrete... Adevărata sa forţă iese la iveală prin implicaţiile politice şi spirituale ale peregrinărilor lui prin treisprezece închisori poloneze şi ruseşti în anii ‘30 şi ‘40. Wat începe prin a fi comunist şi evreu şi sfârşeşte ca anticomunist şi creştin care continuă să-şi afirme evreitatea. Mai presus de toate, el îşi apără viaţa interioară...“ (Library Journal)„Ca document al unui martor istoric, Secolul meu este o lucrare extraordinară. Dar, mai mult decât atât, este o capodoperă a genului autobiografic. Vocea lui Wat este irezistibilă, şi el îşi spune povestea cu o asemenea rigoare şi inteligenţă, cu o asemenea căldură umană copleşitoare, încât cuvintele lui te schimbă pentru totdeauna...

Eugenics and Other Evils : An Argument Against the Scientifically Organized State,G.K. Chesterton,3.94,"1,140 rating","January 1, 1922","In the second decade of the twentieth century, an idea became all too fashionable among those who feel it is their right to set social trends. Wealthy families took it on as a pet cause, generously bankrolling its research. The New York Times praised it as a wonderful ""new science."" Scientists, such as the brilliant plant biologist, Luther Burbank, praised it unashamedly. Educators as prominent as Charles Elliot, President of Harvard University, promoted it as a solution to social ills. America's public schools did their part. In the 1920s, almost three-fourths of high school social science textbooks taught its principles. Not to be outdone, judges and physicians called for those principles to be enshrined into law. Congress agree, passing the 1924 immigration law to exclude from American shores the people of Eastern and Southern Europe that the idea branded as inferior. In 1927, the U. S. Supreme Court joined the chorus, ruling by a lopsided vote of 8 to 1 that the sterilization of unwilling men and women was constitutional. That idea was eugenics and in the English-speaking world it had virtually no critics among the ""chattering classes."" When he wrote this book, Chesterton stood virtually alone against the intellectual world of his day. Yet to his eternal credit, he showed no sign of being intimidated by the prestige of his foes. On the contrary, he thunders against eugenics, ranking it one of the great evils of modern society. And, in perhaps one of the most chillingly accurate prophecies of the century, he warns that the ideas that eugenics had unleashed were likely to bear bitter fruit in another nation. That nation was Germany, the ""very land of scientific culture from which the ideal of a Superman had come."" In fact, the very group that Nazism tried to exterminate, Eastern European Jews, and the group it targeted for later extermination, the Slavs, were two of those whose biological unfitness eugenists sought so eagerly to confirm.",179,"3,406","5,082 follower","['Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Science', 'History', 'Classics', 'Eugenics', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Science', 'History', 'Classics', 'Eugenics', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Science', 'History', 'Classics', 'Eugenics']",152 review,386 (33%),405 (35%),262 (22%),68 (5%),19 (1%)
An Armenian Sketchbook,Vasily Grossman,4.05,"1,043 rating","January 1, 1965","An NYRB Classics OriginalFew writers had to confront as many of the last century’s mass tragedies as Vasily Grossman, who wrote with terrifying clarity about the Shoah, the Battle of Stalingrad, and the Terror Famine in the Ukraine. An Armenian Sketchbook, however, shows us a very different Grossman, notable for his tenderness, warmth, and sense of fun.       After the  Soviet government confiscated—or, as Grossman always put it, “arrested”—Life and Fate, he took on the task of revising a literal Russian translation of a long Armenian novel. The novel was of little interest to him, but he needed money and was evidently glad of an excuse to travel to Armenia. An Armenian Sketchbook is his account of the two months he spent there.       This is by far the most personal and intimate of Grossman’s works, endowed with an air of absolute spontaneity, as though he is simply chatting to the reader about his impressions of Armenia—its mountains, its ancient churches, its people—while also examining his own thoughts and moods. A wonderfully human account of travel to a faraway place, An Armenian Sketchbook also has the vivid appeal of a self-portrait.",160,42,817 follower,"['Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Russia', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Russian Literature', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Russia', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Russian Literature', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Russia', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Russian Literature', 'Biography']",163 review,367 (35%),419 (40%),211 (20%),37 (3%),9 (<1%)
