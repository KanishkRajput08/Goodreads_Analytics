Suddenly he took a deep breath and said, 'This reminds me...' ""In his prime, Edward Bloom was an extraordinary man. He could outrun anybody. He never missed a day of school. He saved lives and tamed giants. Animals loved him, people loved him, women loved him. He knew more jokes than any man alive. At least that’s what he told his son, William. But now Edward Bloom is dying, and William wants desperately to know the truth about his elusive father — this indefatigable teller of tall tales — before it’s too late. So, using the few facts he knows, William re-creates Edward’s life in a series of legends and myths, through which he begins to understand his father’s great feats, and his great failings. The result is hilarious and wrenching, tender and outrageous.Big Fish is the story of this man's life, told from father to son, some fact, some fiction. But the result is a powerful and transformative act of storytelling, and one way to make amends with the bridge between life and death.",192,"['Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Magical Realism', 'Contemporary', 'Adult Fiction', 'Humor', 'Adult']",411 follower,"2,341 review",76,443 (1%),"2,011 (8%)","7,033 (30%)","8,338 (36%)","5,052 (22%)"

The people in Anne Lamott's real life are like beloved characters in a favorite series for her readers: Her friend Pammy; her son, Sam; and the many funny and wise folks who attend her church are all familiar. And Traveling Mercies is a welcome return to those lives, as well as an introduction to new companions Lamott treats with the same candor, insight, and tenderness. Lamott's faith isn't about easy answers, which is part of what endears her to believers as well as nonbelievers. Against all odds, she came to believe in God, and then, even more miraculously, in herself. As she puts it, ""My coming to faith did not start with a leap but rather a series of staggers.""

Elements of Semiology,Roland Barthes,3.79,973 rating,"January 1, 1964","""In his Course in General Linguistics , first published in 1916, Saussure postulated the existence of a general science of signs, or Semiology, of which linguistics would form only one part. Semiology, therefore aims to take in any system of signs, whatever their substance and limits; images, gestures, musical sounds, objects, and the complex associations of all these, which form the content of ritual, convention or public these constitute, if not languages , at least systems of signification . . . The Elements here presented have as their sole aim the extraction from linguistics of analytical concepts which we think a priori to be sufficiently general to start semiological research on its way. In assembling them, it is not presupposed that they will remain intact during the course of research; nor that semiology will always be forced to follow the linguistic model closely. We are merely suggesting and elucidating a terminology in the hope that it may enable an initial (albeit provisional) order to be introduced into the heterogeneous mass of significant facts. In fact what we purport to do is furnish a principle of classification of the questions. These elements of semiology will therefore be grouped under four main headings borrowed from structural I.

Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times: Soviet Russia in the 1930s,Sheila Fitzpatrick,3.91,"1,203 rating","March 4, 1999","Here is a pioneering account of everyday life under Stalin, written by one of our foremost authorities on modern Russian history.Focusing on urban areas in the 1930s, Sheila Fitzpatrick shows that with the adoption of collectivization and the first Five-Year Plan, everyday life was utterly transformed. With the abolition of the market, shortages of food, clothing, and all kinds of consumer goods became endemic. Aspeasants fled the collectivized villages, major cities were soon in the grip of an acute housing crisis, with families jammed for decades in tiny single rooms in communal apartments, counting living space in square meters. It was a world of privation, overcrowding, endless queues, and brokenfamilies, in which the regime's promises of future socialist abundance rang hollowly. We read of a government bureaucracy that often turned everyday life into a nightmare, and of the ways that ordinary citizens tried to circumvent it, primarily by patronage and the ubiquitous system of personalconnections known as blat . And we read of the police surveillance that was endemic to this society, and the waves of terror like the Great Purges of 1937, that periodically cast this world into turmoil. Fitzpatrick illuminates the ways that Soviet city-dwellers coped with this world, examining suchdiverse activities as shopping, traveling, telling jokes, finding an apartment, getting an education, landing a job, cultivating patrons and connections, marrying and raising a family, writing complaints and denunciations, voting, and trying to steer clear of the secret police.Based on extensive research in Soviet archives only recently opened to historians, this superb book illuminates the ways ordinary people tried to live normal lives under extraordinary circumstances.",288,"['History', 'Russia', 'Nonfiction', 'Russian History', 'Politics', 'Soviet History', 'Soviet Union']",115 follower,72 review,43,17 (1%),49 (4%),294 (24%),506 (42%),337 (28%)

Gemini,Dorothy Dunnett,4.50,"1,816 rating","January 1, 2000","Scotland, 1477: Nicholas de Fleury, former banker and merchant, has re-appeared in the land that, four years earlier, he had brought very close to ruin in the course of an intense commercial and personal war with secret enemies—and, indeed, with his clever wife Gelis.Now the opportunity for redemption is at hand, but Nicholas soon finds himself pursuing his objectives amid a complex, corrosive power struggle centering on the Scottish royal family but closely involving the powerful merchants of Edinburgh, the gentry, the clergy, the English (ever seeking an excuse to pounce on their neighbor to the north), the French, the Burgundians. His presence soon draws Gelis and their son Jodi to Scotland, as well as Nicholas's companions and subordinates in many a past endeavor—Dr. Tobias and his wife Clémence, Mick Crackbene, John le Grant, and Andro Wodman among them. Here, too, Nicholas meets again with others who have had an influence, for good or evil, in his King James III of Scotland and his rebellious siblings; the St. Jordan, Simon, and young Henry; Mistress Bel of Cuthilgurdy and David de Salmeton; Anselm Adorne and Kathi his niece. Caught up in, and sometimes molding, the course of great events, Nicholas exhibits by turns the fierce silence with which he masks his secrets, and the explosive, willful gaiety that binds men, women, and children to him. And as the secrets of his birth and heritage come to light, Nicholas has to decide whether he desires to establish a future in Scotland for himself and his family, and a home for his descendants.Gemini  brings to a dazzling conclusion Dorothy Dunnett's  House of Niccolò  series (synopsized in this volume), in which this peerless novelist has vividly re-created the dramatic, flamboyant world of the early Renaissance in historical writing of scrupulous authenticity and in the entrancing portrait of her visionary hero. Now, in a book infused with wit and poetry, emotion and humor, action and mystery, she brings Nicholas de Fleury at last to choose his heart's home, where he can exercise all his skills as an advisor to kings and statesmen, as a husband, a father, and a leader of men—and where, perhaps, we will discern a connection between him and that other remarkable personality, Francis Crawford, whose exploits Lady Dunnett recorded so memorably in  The Lymond Chronicles.",672,"['Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fiction', 'Scotland', 'Adventure', 'Romance', 'Fantasy']",788 follower,112 review,48,10 (<1%),30 (1%),154 (8%),473 (26%),"1,149 (63%)"

Traiul populației din Siliștea-Gumești nu e ușor deloc, decât pentru câteva familii înstărite, familiile unora ca alde Aristide, Cotelici, Bălosu sau Iocan, dar nici peste masură de amărât nu este. Îi apasă pe mulți impozitele, fonciirea și alte neajunsuri dar ele pot fi încă suportate de oameni, care se adună cu plăcere duminica, la taifas, în poiana lui Iocan unde citesc ziare, povestesc anecdote, glumesc, angajându-se în adevărate dueluri ale inteligenței.Siliștea-Gumești este o comună mare, cu două biserici, o școală cu patru sute cincizeci de elevi încriși și vreo șapte învățători. Hotarul comunei cuprinde, loturi mai vaste sau mai restrânse ale țăranilor și moșia Maricica, vegheată cu strășnicie de un paznic. Afară de bogătașii satului, care au case mari, țăranii ceilalți viețuiesc în case cu două sau trei camere și chiar în bordeie.Gospodăria Moromeților pare solidă și grija conducătorului ei este s-o mențină intactă.

Stalin,Edvard Radzinsky,4.05,"1,781 rating","January 1, 1995","From the author of The Last Tsar, the first full-scale life of Stalin to have what no previous biography has fully obtained: the facts. Granted privileged access to Russia's secret archives, Edvard Radzinsky paints a picture of the Soviet strongman as more calculating, ruthless, and blood-crazed than has ever been described or imagined. Stalin was a man for whom power was all, terror a useful weapon, and deceit a constant companion.As Radzinsky narrates the high drama of Stalin's epic quest for domination-first within the Communist Party, then over the Soviet Union and the world-he uncovers the startling truth about this most enigmatic of historical figures. Only now, in the post-Soviet era, can what was suppressed be told: Stalin's long-denied involvement with terrorism as a young revolutionary; the crucial importance of his misunderstood, behind-the-scenes role during the October Revolution; his often hostile relationship with Lenin; the details of his organization of terror, culminating in the infamous show trials of the 1930s; his secret dealings with Hitler, and how they backfired; and the horrifying plans he was making before his death to send the Soviet Union's Jews to concentration camps-tantamount to a potential second Holocaust. Radzinsky also takes an intimate look at Stalin's private life, marked by his turbulent relationship with his wife Nadezhda, and recreates the circumstances that led to her suicide.As he did in The Last Tsar, Radzinsky thrillingly brings the past to life. The Kremlin intrigues, the ceaseless round of double-dealing and back-stabbing, the private worlds of the Soviet Empire's ruling class-all become, in Radzinsky's hands, as gripping and powerful as the great Russian sagas. And the riddle of that most cold-blooded of leaders, a man for whom nothing was sacred in his pursuit of absolute might--and perhaps the greatest mass murderer in Western history--is solved.",640,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Russia', 'Politics', 'Russian History', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Russia', 'Politics', 'Russian History', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Russia', 'Politics', 'Russian History', 'Biography Memoir']",87 follower,151 review,75,23 (1%),62 (3%),353 (19%),706 (39%),637 (35%)

Describing dreams as communications from the unconscious, Jung explains how the symbols that occur in dreams compensate for repressed emotions and intuitions.

Apesar de marcar o término da série, com a decadência dos senhores de engenho, o romance também assinala seu auge, seu momento de superação, constituindo uma obra-prima da literatura regionalista, de caráter neo-realista. ""Descendente de senhores de engenho, o romancista soube fundir numa linguagem de forte e poética oralidade as recordações da infância e da adolescência com o registro intenso da vida nordestina colhida por dentro, através dos processos mentais de homens e mulheres que representam a gama étnica e social da região"", descreve o crítico literário Alfredo Bosi, em História Concisa da Literatura Brasileira. O romance, narrado em terceira pessoa, é dividido em três partes. Cada uma conta com seu próprio protagonista, como se fossem três histórias distintas e sucessivas. No entanto, os personagens principais (mestre José Amaro, Coronel Lula de Holanda e o Capitão Vitorino) se inter-relacionam durante toda a narrativa, quase inteiramente ambientada no Engenho de Santa Fé. Na primeira parte, o mestre José Amaro - seleiro orgulhoso e conservador - espalha rancor à sua volta. Temido pelo povo da várzea por sua aparência horrível e pela raiva acumulada, ele surra a filha histérica com o intuito de curá-la (mas acaba por enlouquecê-la) e maltrata a esposa (que por fim foge com a menina). Na segunda parte do romance, o coronel Lula de Holanda, também orgulhoso, não consegue fazer prosperar o engenho que recebera de herança. Autoritário, não permite que nenhum homem se aproxime da filha, que permanece solteirona e melancólica. Depois de sofrer um ataque de epilepsia na igreja, torna-se devoto. Gasta todo o dinheiro que lhe restou. Por fim leva o engenho a fogo morto (propriedade que não produz mais).

Chesterton, the ""Prince of Paradox,"" is at his witty best in this collection of twenty essays and articles from the turn of the twentieth century. Focusing on ""heretics"" — those who pride themselves on their superiority to Christian views — Chesterton appraises prominent figures who fall into that category from the literary and art worlds. Luminaries such as Rudyard Kipling, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and James McNeill Whistler come under the author's scrutiny, where they meet with equal measures of his characteristic wisdom and good humor.In addition to incisive assessments of well-known individuals (""Mr. Rudyard Kipling and Making the World Small"" and ""Mr. H. G. Wells and the Giants""), these essays contain observations on the wider world. ""On Sandals and Simplicity,"" ""Science and the Savages,"" ""On Certain Modern Writers and the Institution of the Family,"" ""On Smart Novelists and the Smart Set,"" and ""Slum Novelists and the Slums"" reflect the main themes of Chesterton's life's work. Heretics roused the ire of some critics for censuring contemporary philosophies without providing alternatives; the author responded a few years later with a companion volume, Orthodoxy. Sardonic, jolly, and generous, both books are vintage Chesterton.He is criticizing those who hold incomplete and inadequate views about ""life, the universe, and everything."" He is, in short, criticizing all that host of non-Christian views of reality, as he demonstrated in his follow-up book Orthodoxy. The book is both an easy read and a difficult read. But he manages to demonstrate, among other things, that our new 21st century heresies are really not new because he himself deals with most of them.",176,"['Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Theology', 'Nonfiction', 'Christian', 'Christianity', 'Classics']","5,082 follower",497 review,"3,406",32 (<1%),169 (3%),795 (16%),"1,836 (37%)","2,089 (42%)"

He analyzes previous contributions to a Marxist theory of literature from Marx himself to Lukacs, Althusser, and Goldmann, and develops his own approach by outlining a theory of cultural materialism' which integrates Marxist theories of language with Marxist theories of literature. Williams moves from a review of the growth of the concepts of literature and idealogy to a redefinition of determinism' and hegemony'. His incisive discussion of the 'social material process' of cultural activity culminates in a re-examination of the problems of alignment and commitment and of the creative practice in individual authors and wider social groups.",224,"['Philosophy', 'Theory', 'Nonfiction', 'Literary Criticism', 'Politics', 'Criticism', 'Cultural Studies']",231 follower,57 review,193,43 (2%),80 (4%),299 (18%),485 (30%),709 (43%)

Concerning the Spiritual in Art,Wassily Kandinsky,3.84,"86,144 rating","January 1, 1912","A pioneering work in the movement to free art from its traditional bonds to material reality, this book is one of the most important documents in the history of modern art. Written by the famous nonobjective painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866–1944), it explains Kandinsky's own theory of painting and crystallizes the ideas that were influencing many other modern artists of the period. Along with his own groundbreaking paintings, this book had a tremendous impact on the development of modern art.Kandinsky's ideas are presented in two parts. The first part, called ""About General Aesthetic,"" issues a call for a spiritual revolution in painting that will let artists express their own inner lives in abstract, non-material terms. Just as musicians do not depend upon the material world for their music, so artists should not have to depend upon the material world for their art. In the second part, ""About Painting,"" Kandinsky discusses the psychology of colors, the language of form and color, and the responsibilities of the artist. An Introduction by the translator, Michael T. H. Sadler, offers additional explanation of Kandinsky's art and theories, while a new Preface by Richard Stratton discusses Kandinsky's career as a whole and the impact of the book. Making the book even more valuable are nine woodcuts by Kandinsky himself that appear at the chapter headings.This English translation of Über das Geistige in der Kunst was a significant contribution to the understanding of nonobjectivism in art. It continues to be a stimulating and necessary reading experience for every artist, art student, and art patron concerned with the direction of 20th-century painting.",80,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Art History', 'Spirituality', 'Religion', 'Classics', 'Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Art History', 'Spirituality', 'Religion', 'Classics', 'Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Art History', 'Spirituality', 'Religion', 'Classics']",276 follower,494 review,168,"5,806 (6%)","6,826 (7%)","17,330 (20%)","21,411 (24%)","34,771 (40%)"

The Tragedy of American Compassion,Marvin Olasky,4.06,283 rating,"March 1, 1992","Can a man be content with a piece of bread and some change tossed his way from a passerby? Today's modern welfare state expects he can. Those who control the money in our society think that giving a dollar at the train station and then appropriating a billion dollars for federal housing can cure the ails of the homeless and the poor. But the crisis of the modern welfare state is more than a crisis of government. Private charities that dispense aid indiscriminately while ignoring the moral and spiritual needs of the poor are also to blame. Like animals in the zoo at feeding time, the needy are given a plate of food but rarely receive the love and time that only a person can give. Poverty fighters 100 years ago were more compassionate--in the literal meaning of ""suffering with""--than many of us are now. They opened their own homes to deserted women and children. They offered employment to nomadic men who had abandoned hope and human contact. Most significantly, they made moral demands on recipients of aid. They saw family, work, freedom, and faith as central to our being, not as life-style options. No one was allowed to eat and run. Some kind of honest labor was required of those who needed food or a place to sleep in return. Woodyards next to homeless shelters were as common in the 1890s as liquor stores are in the 1990s. When an able bodied woman sought relief, she was given a seat in the ""sewing room"" and asked to work on garments given to the helpless poor. To begin where poverty fighters a century ago began, Marvin Olasky emphasizes seven ideas that recent welfare practice has put affiliation, bonding, categorization, discernment, employment, freedom, and most importantly, belief in God. In the end, not much will be accomplished without a spiritual revival that transforms the everyday advice we give and receive, and the way we lead our lives. It's time we realized that there is only so much that public policy can do. That only a richness of spirit can battle a poverty of soul. The century-old question--does any given scheme of help... make great demands on men to give themselves to their brethren?--is still the right one to ask. Most of our 20th-century schemes have failed. It's time to learn from the warm hearts and hard heads of the 19th-century. ""We are indebted to Olasky for bringing past lessons of history to bear on a present cultural crisis. Another great work by one of today's foremost thinkers."" --Charles W. Colson, Chairman, Prison Fellowship ""A comprehensive, well documented, and much needed study of the decline of true compassion that provides fresh analysis and provocative insight into the causes and cures of this American tragedy.
