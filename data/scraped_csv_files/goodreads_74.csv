Hinckley, has created a classic look at the values that can change our world--and how to stand up for them. Drawing on anecdotes from his much-admired life of faith and service, as well as examples from American culture today, he examines ten virtues that have always illuminated the path to a better world: love, honesty, morality, civility, learning, forgiveness and mercy, thrift and industry, gratitude, optimism, and faith. He then shows how the two guardians of virtue--marriage and the family--can keep us on that path, even in difficult times.

Kennedy, his murder continues to haunt the American psyche and stands as a turning point in our nation’s history. The Warren Commission rushed out its report in 1964, but questions continue to linger: Was there a conspiracy? Was there a coup at the highest levels of government?On March 1, 1967, New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison shocked the world by arresting local businessman Clay Shaw for conspiracy to murder the president. His alleged co-conspirator, David Ferrie, had been found dead a few days before. Garrison charged that elements of the United States government, in particular the CIA, were behind the crime. From the beginning, his probe was virulently attacked in the media and violently denounced from Washington. His office was infiltrated and sabotaged, and witnesses disappeared and died strangely. Eventually, Shaw was acquitted after the briefest of jury deliberation and the only prosecution ever brought for the murder of President Kennedy was over.Returning to print for the first time in years, On the Trail of the Assassins—the primary source material for Oliver Stone’s hit film JFK—is Garrison’s own account of his investigations into the background of Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of President Kennedy, and his prosecution of Clay Shaw in the trial that followed.",342,36,33 follower,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Politics', 'Crime', 'Historical', 'Conspiracy Theories']",141 review,785 (39%),721 (36%),349 (17%),82 (4%),50 (2%)

To say the least he is not apparently the stuff from which heroes are fashioned.As an agricultural expert specializing in fruit farming, Arthur becomes a Peace Corps volunteer and is assigned to the Republic of San Marco in the Caribbean. This weak-chinned Don Quixote soon acquires his Sancho Panza in the person of a rascally eleven-year-old boy, Pepe, who makes a bargain to be paid 400 pesos each time he saves Arthur's life. (The payments mount alarmingly!)The island's dictator thinks he can use Arthur to obtain military supplies with which to wipe out the band of guerillas in the hills who oppose his corrupt dictatorship. Failing in this the dictator decides to murder Goodpasture and cause an international incident by blaming it on the guerillas. This, he reasons, will bring the U.S. in to help stamp out the rebels.This plan also backfires (with Pepe's help, of course) and Goodpasture is taken prisoner and when they see he is a harmless eccentric he is appointed chief cook for the guerillas. From then on Arthur's life becomes a series of misadventures through which he moves serenely and from which he generally emerges unscathed (again with Pepe's assistance) until he surprisingly finds himself the guerillas' leader.Following one of the funniest bloodless revolutions imaginable Arthur Peabody Goodpasture ends up as Arthur el Gavilan, the new dictator of San Marco.

Here is a rare opportunity to eavesdrop on two cinematic masters from very different backgrounds as they cover each of Hitch's films in succession. Though this book was initially published in 1967 when Hitchcock was still active, Truffaut later prepared a revised edition that covered the final stages of his career. It's difficult to think of a more informative or entertaining introduction to Hitchcock's art, interests, and peculiar sense of humor. The book is a storehouse of insight and witticism, including the master's impressions of a classic like Rear Window (""I was feeling very creative at the time, the batteries were well charged""), his technical insight into Psycho's shower scene (""the knife never touched the body; it was all done in the [editing]""), and his ruminations on flops such as Under Capricorn (""If I were to make another picture in Australia today, I'd have a policeman hop into the pocket of a kangaroo and yell 'Follow that car!'"").

Η δράση τοποθετείται αντίστοιχα στην Ιερουσαλήμ, στο Κάιρο, στην Αλεξάνδρεια. Ένα μυθιστόρημα που τιθασεύει αριστοτεχνικά μια χειμαρρώδη ιστορική ύλη, δίνοντας ανθρώπινη φωνή στο έπος και στο δράμα του Β΄ Παγκοσμίου Πολέμου, την ώρα που κρινόταν το μέλλον των λαών και παίχτηκε στα ζάρια η τύχη της Ελλάδας. Χάρη σε ποικίλες αναδρομές, η τριλογία ζωντανεύει και προγενέστερες περιόδους, από τον Μεσοπόλεμο, τον χλωρό παράδεισο της εφηβείας με τα πρώτα ερωτικά σκιρτήματα κάποιων ηρώων, ως την παλιά Αίγυπτο, ανακαλώντας μνήμες προγόνων. Το έργο κορυφώνεται με την εξέγερση του Στρατού και του Στόλου, το κίνημα του Απρίλη 1944 και τη δραματική καταστολή του, ενώ, με τον επίλογο του γ΄ τόμου, μεταφερόμαστε στη Θεσσαλονίκη μετά τον Εμφύλιο, το 1954, όπου ακούγεται ένα συγκλονιστικό ρέκβιεμ για τους χαμένους αγωνιστές.Ωστόσο, ο Τσίρκας δεν έγραψε χρονικό, αλλά έργο τέχνης. Ιστορική ακρίβεια και φαντασία σπάνια δένονται σ' ένα τόσο αρμονικό σύνολο.

Πολιτικές μηχανορραφίες, αχαλίνωτες φιλοδοξίες μέσα στη δίνη του πολέμου, αλλά και ωραία όνειρα και περίσσευμα ανθρωπιάς και γενναιότητας δίνουν το στίγμα των ""Ακυβέρνητων Πολιτειών"", όπου ο έρωτας, κυρίαρχος, τυλίγει και ξετυλίγει το νήμα μιας συναρπαστικής πλοκής. Παράλληλα, με την πολυφωνία της αφήγησης και άλλες νεωτερικές τεχνοτροπίες, ο συγγραφέας κατορθώνει να συγχωνεύσει τον μοντερνισμό με την παράδοση.

Printre ştiintele omului căzut din har, economia şi etica proprietăţii private tot mai contrafactuale şi ale agresiunii instituţionalizate tot mai actuale îşi dovedesc la superlativ aptitudinea de a explica dinamica devolutivă a competiţiei pentru materie şi putere. Sesizând ordinea proprietăţii private exclusiv în ipostaza ei progresiv capitalistă, profesorul Hoppe demonstrează fără dificultate superioritatea economică şi etică relativă a acestui tip ideal, faţă de sistemele alternative, ideale sau existente, compatibile cu orientarea programatic pământească şi (deci) consumeristă a omului recent. Paradoxul creşterii sufocante a statului, în ciuda iraţionalităţii sale sociale, ţine însă de o cvasi-implacabilă logică a stimulentelor şi efectelor socio-psihologice perverse asociate dinamicii sale interne, care probabil nu pot fi depăşite de sugestii strategice care nu «sparg» şi cutia presupoziţiilor teo-antropologice scolastico-nihiliste ale autorului.“Dan Cristian Comănescu",317,98,483 follower,"['Economics', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Business']",31 review,253 (53%),150 (31%),46 (9%),13 (2%),13 (2%)

Motivul e simplu. Capitalismul si istoricii demonteaza cu argumente clare si viguroase o conceptie adanc inradacinata in opinia comuna – o „axioma istorica“ pe care generatii intregi si-au insusit-o din manuale, impreuna cu Marx, cu fabianistii, cu grosul intelectualitatii (de stanga, centru si dreapta), cu ecologistii, cu avocatii contemporani ai societatii civile, ba chiar si cu majoritatea liberalilor – toti impartasim viziunea dickensiana potrivit careia in Anglia „capitalismului primitiv“ era o vale a plangerii, plina de fabrici mohorate in care erau exploatati la sange muncitori (inclusiv copii!), alungati de industrializare din raiul societatii agrare traditionale si aruncati in mahalalele marilor orase...

The Last Precinct,Patricia Cornwell,3.89,"38,348 rating","October 16, 2000","Patricia Cornwell's legendary crime fiction creation, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta, has logged a host of fans among mystery readers and, within the bounds of her fictional world, an equally impressive tally of individuals intent on causing her grievous physical or psychological harm.The 11th Scarpetta novel, The Last Precinct, doesn't add any new names to the second roster. Instead, in a sweeping narrative gesture toward retrospection (less-than-fervent fans might whisper ""or stagnation""), the novel depends largely on ground already covered in its predecessors, Black Notice and, to a lesser extent, Point of Origin. All the familiar faces--friend and foe--are here: police captain Marino, Kay's niece Lucy, the so-called Werewolf murderer, and (in memoriam) Kay's lover Benton Wesley and his killer, Carrie Grethen. Kay, who nearly killed the Werewolf in self-defense as Black Notice came to a close, now finds herself the target of a corrupt police investigation that will dredge her darkest secrets from the deepest corners of her past.Torn between a desire to clear her name and the instinct of a wounded animal to turn against even its would-be rescuers, Kay sifts through the forensic evidence that seems to link Chandonne to other horrific events in her past, up to and including Wesley's murder. Physical analysis, however, will not be enough to right her up-ended world. Instead, Kay must rely on the strategic support of her niece, cofounder of the Last Precinct (an odd, ill-defined organization that is, in the words of its motto, ""where you go when there is nowhere left""), and on her willingness to examine her own fears, misconceptions, and anything-but-altruistic motives. The most important setting in this novel is not the morgue--it's the living room where Kay's therapist forces her to address (you guessed it) ""unresolved issues."" The novel's focus on Kay's emotional evolution does not, unfortunately, mask the leaps of illogic that pepper the plot's murky stew. More disturbing than these occasional lapses, however, is the feeling that Cornwell has written herself into a corner. The Scarpetta of The Last Precinct is a far cry from the irritably independent woman of previous books. Her often over-inflated musings are more tiresome than tantalizing. Cornwell's impressive track record makes this excursion a bit disappointing, but that same record means that loyal fans will race to acquire the book anyway and that the odds of her returning to her usual stellar form next time are (hurrah!) favorable. --Kelly Flynn",468,310,17.4k follower,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Murder Mystery']",786 review,"11,652 (30%)","14,153 (36%)","9,801 (25%)","2,177 (5%)",565 (1%)

Hayek,4.15,"2,710 rating","January 1, 1960","Prefata la The Constitution of Liberty este datata 1959, pentru a indica faptul ca Hayek dorea, printre altele, ca lucrarea sa sa comemoreze centenarul editiei originale a volumului lui John Stuart Mill, On Liberty (1859). Dedicatia (), avea menirea sa exprime opinia lui Hayek ca in Statele Unite avea loc o renastere a liberalismului clasic, ca aici urma sa ia nastere o societate mai libertara. Scopul volumului era acela de a reafirma ideaurile libertatii care vor inspira cresterea neintrerupta a civilizatiei libere, occidentale. În acelasi timp, era o incercare de a crea mijlocul (o constitutie a libertatii) prin care societatile puteau deveni si ramine libere. Era o lucrare extrem de ambitioasa si optimista: .Cartea este impartita in trei mari parti. Prima este o aparare a valorii libertatii (). Hayek face distinctia intre si , sustine superioritatea creatoare a societatilor libere si legatura intre acestea si continuarea progresului. Urmatoarele teme explorate sint relatia intre libertate, ratiune si traditie, teme deja proeminente in corpusul hayekian si legatura intre responsabilitate si libertate. Sectiunea se incheie cu o discutie a diverselor amenintari si posibile capcane cu care se confrunta societatile democratice: egalitate versus merit, regula majoritatii versus drepturi individuale, precum si modurile in care lumea materiala ne afecteaza libertatea (problema angajarii).Partea a doua se refera la libertate si drept (). Hayek pune in evidenta legatura strinsa intre traditia statului de drept si cresterea libertatii in Marea Britanie si Statele Unite. Sint trecute in revista natura coercitiva a statului, garantiile constitutionale si juridice necesare unei societati libere ( unei societati libere) si dimensiunile istorice ale statului de drept. Autorul examineaza traditia constitutionala americana si alte traditii juridice, in special din perspectiva garantiilor oferite libertatii individuale. Sectiunea continua cu discutarea modului in care interactioneaza si a celui in care ar trebui sa interactioneze politica economica si statul de drept si se incheie cu o analiza a declinului statului de drept, in fata pozitivismului juridic si a activismului judiciar si administrativ.A treia si ultima sectiune a volumului este consacrata problemelor cu care se confrunta libertatea in statul bunastarii (). Fara nici o indoiala, socialismul clasic fusese invins si cazuse deja in dizgratie, la sfirsitul anilor 1950, cu exceptia locurilor unde fusese impus, prin forta armelor, de catre sovietici. Însa el lasa in urma o intreaga panoplie de masuri interventioniste si crease societati ale dependentei, ostile sau in orice caz nefavorabile libertatii. În Occident, abandonarea idealului socialist propriu­zis nu insemna ca libertatea obtinuse victoria, intrucit statul bunastarii crease clase defavorizate, alaturi de noi clientele. Hayek analizeaza diverse aspecte ale statului bunastarii: sindicatele, schemele de impozitare ce vizau redistribuirea veniturilor, politicile in domenii precum agricultura si educatia; el arata cum acestea pot constitui pericole pentru libertate, pe termen scurt si pe termen lung. The Constitution of Liberty este o carte mare, o adevarata enciclopedie de idei, concepte si opinii liberale; in fine, ea este un extrem de valoros izvor de idei pozitive. Fiind o lucrare de o mare densitate si eruditie, ea nu a atins niciodata popularitatea volumului The Road to Serfdom. Pe de alta parte, pentru liderii de opinie si pentru cei ce lucreaza la construirea unor societati libere, The Constitution of Liberty este o resursa esentiala.",584,235,"1,464 follower","['Economics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Law', 'Economics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Law', 'Economics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Law', 'Economics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Law', 'Economics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Law']",124 review,"1,308 (48%)",798 (29%),402 (14%),114 (4%),88 (3%)

Acclaimed by The Wall Street Journal as ""brilliantly researched and written,"" the book tells the rich, panoramic story of four generations of Morgans and the powerful, secretive firms they spawned. It is the definitive account of the rise of the modern financial world. A gripping history of banking and the booms and busts that shaped the world on both sides of the Atlantic, The House of Morgan traces the trajectory of the J. P. Morgan empire from its obscure beginnings in Victorian London to the crash of 1987. Ron Chernow paints a fascinating portrait of the private saga of the Morgans and the rarefied world of the American and British elite in which they moved.

"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929-1964",Robert Silverberg,4.32,"6,146 rating","April 1, 1970","If you own only one anthology of classic science fiction, it should be The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964. Selected by a vote of the membership of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), these 26 reprints represent the best, most important, and most influential stories and authors in the field. The contributors are a Who's Who of classic SF, with every Golden Age giant included: Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, John W. Campbell, Robert A. Heinlein, Fritz Leiber, Cordwainer Smith, Theodore Sturgeon, and Roger Zelazny. Other contributors are less well known outside the core SF readership. Three of the contributors are famous for one story--but what stories!--Tom Godwin's pivotal hard-SF tale, ""The Cold Equations""; Jerome Bixby's ""It's a Good Life"" (made only more infamous by the chilling Twilight Zone adaptation); and Daniel Keyes's ""Flowers for Algernon"" (brought to mainstream fame by the movie adaptation, Charly). The collection has some minor but frustrating flaws. There are no contributor biographies, which is bad enough when the author is a giant; but it's especially sad for contributors who have become unjustly obscure. Each story's original publication date is in small print at the bottom of the first page. And neither this fine print nor the copyright page identifies the magazines in which the stories first appeared. Prefaced by editor Robert Silverberg's introduction, which describes SFWA and details the selection process, The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964 is a wonderful book for the budding SF fan. Experienced SF readers should compare the table of contents to their library before making a purchase decision. Fans who contemplate giving this book to non-SF readers should bear in mind that, while several of the collected stories can measure up to classic mainstream literary stories, the less literarily-acceptable stories are weighted toward the front of the collection; adult mainstream-literature fans may not get very far into The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964. --Cynthia Ward· Introduction · Robert Silverberg · in · A Martian Odyssey [Tweel] · Stanley G.

Like most of his fiction, it revolves around a gallery of grotesque characters motivated by the basest urges. The novel's central figure is Blondy Niles, a down-and-out boxer who exists at the very fringes of society. The garish nighttime world of bars and prostitutes, con men and petty crimes is the milieu in which he moves. When he is approached by Salty Banks to be an unwitting fall guy in a rigged boxing scheme, a calamitous chain of events is set in motion, and death is the inevitable result.Blondy is befriended by a good-hearted prostitute, Louise, but then comes under the powerful, mysterious spell of the gruesome Mrs. Boxx, an enormous, soulless woman who lures him to her house, which has been converted into the most primitive of abortion mills. Despite the terrible acts Mrs. Boxx oversees and that Blondy is compelled to participate in, he inexplicably finds himself unable - or unwilling - to leave this chamber of horror. Only with the help of Dorothy, Mrs. Boxx's younger, daughter, does he finally free himself from the clutches of this demonic, madwoman. Yet freedom proves elusive, for by the end of this surreal, phantasmagoric adventure, Blondy and everyone he cares for have come to a bloody end.Caldwell himself likened Poor Fool to a ""diabolical dream.""
