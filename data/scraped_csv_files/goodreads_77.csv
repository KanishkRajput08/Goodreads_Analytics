Offering a wealth of evidence, including rare photos, documents, and interviews, Marrs, a veteran Texas journalist, reveals the telltale signs of the conspiracy: early government manipulation of the famous Zapruder film, falsification of evidence, the intimidation of witnesses after the assassination, the theft of Oswald's identity during the countdown to the tragedy, and much more.

Robert Nozick ia in serios contestarea anarhista a legitimitatii morale a statului si considera ca intrebarea „De ce trebuie sa existe statul – si nu pur si simplu anarhia?“ constituie problema fundamentala a filozofiei politice, meritand un raspuns temeinic. Argumentele aduse de autor demonstreaza indreptatirea unui „stat minimal“, ale carui functii s-ar limita la protectia individului (de violenta, furt, inselatorie) si la asigurarea respectarii contractelor.

Here are the adventures of Father Bear, Mother Antelope, the little boy Fox, and, of course, Old Man Coyote in a time when people and animals weren't so very far apart.

True to the playful and imaginative spirit he portrays, de Angulo mischievously recommends to readers: ""When you find yourself searching for some mechanical explanation, if you don't know the answer, invent one.

The Roots of Romanticism,Isaiah Berlin,4.31,"1,313 rating","January 1, 1965","The Roots of Romanticism at last makes available in printed form Isaiah Berlin's most celebrated lecture series, the Mellon lectures, delivered in Washington in 1965, recorded by the BBC, and broadcast several times. A published version has been keenly awaited ever since the lectures were given, and Berlin had always hoped to complete a book based on them. But despite extensive further work this hope was not fulfilled, and the present volume is an edited transcript of his spoken words.For Berlin, the Romantics set in motion a vast, unparalleled revolution in humanity's view of itself. They destroyed the traditional notions of objective truth and validity in ethics with incalculable, all-pervasive results. As he said of the Romantics ""The world has never been the same since, and our politics and morals have been deeply transformed by them. Certainly this has been the most radical, and indeed dramatic, not to say terrifying, change in men's outlook in modern times.""In these brilliant lectures Berlin surveys the myriad attempts to define Romanticism, distills its essence, traces its developments from its first stirrings to its apotheosis, and shows how its lasting legacy permeates our own outlook. Combining the freshness and immediacy of the spoken word with Berlin's inimitable eloquence and wit, the lectures range over a cast of the greatest thinkers and artists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including Kant, Rousseau, Diderot, Schiller, Schlegel, Novalis, Goethe, Blake, Byron, and Beethoven. Berlin argues that the ideas and attitudes held by these and other figures helped to shape twentieth-century nationalism, existentialism, democracy, totalitarianism, and our ideas about heroic individuals, individual self-fulfillment, and the exalted place of art. This is the record of an intellectual bravura performance--of one of the century's most influential philosophers dissecting and assessing a movement that changed the course of history.",192,165,685 follower,"['Philosophy', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Romanticism', 'Art', 'Literary Criticism', 'Politics']",146 review,626 (47%),507 (38%),144 (10%),31 (2%),5 (<1%)

One of them, a huge Alaunt, mated with a wolf captured and kept by the count for the urine used as a bait to trap other wolves. Only one of their pups survives and grows into a wolf-dog demonstrating the characteristics of each parent ― huge and fearsome and capable of anything. When the castle is attacked and looted by roaming écorcheurs and the count murdered, the young wolf-dog escapes into the ravaged countryside where he joins a wolf pack and becomes a daunting and unflinching leader. Driven by starvation and tempted by human corpses in the war torn villages, the wolf-dog becomes a man-eater. Later, forced to roam through district after district locked in the jaws of a brutal winter, the now legendary Courtaud breaches the walls of Paris and leads his pack into the city. Just when it seems as if the ravenous wolves will scour the city unchecked, they are faced with a courageous opponent who vows to end the lives of the wolves or lose his own. Based on records of a wolf pack that killed forty people in Paris in the mid-15th century and set against the backdrop of a warring medieval society, The Wolves of Paris explores the circumstances under which man-eating animals evolve.'",234,31,52 follower,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Animals', 'Wolves', 'Historical', 'France']",22 review,41 (34%),47 (39%),23 (19%),7 (5%),0 (0%)

Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism,Chögyam Trungpa,4.22,"8,469 rating","January 1, 1973","In this modern spiritual classic, the Tibetan meditation master Chögyam Trungpa highlights the commonest pitfall to which every aspirant on the spiritual path falls prey: what he calls spiritual materialism.  The universal tendency, he shows, is to see spirituality as a process of self-improvement—the impulse to develop and refine the ego when the ego is, by nature, essentially empty. ""The problem is that ego can convert anything to its own use,"" he said, ""even spirituality."" His incisive, compassionate teachings serve to wake us up from this trick we all play on ourselves, and to offer us a far brighter reality: the true and joyous liberation that inevitably involves letting go of the self rather than working to improve it. It is a message that has resonated with students for nearly thirty years, and remains fresh as ever today. This new edition includes a foreword by Chögyam Trungpa's son and lineage holder, Sakyong Mipham.",272,183,752 follower,"['Buddhism', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Psychology', 'Self Help']",323 review,"4,230 (49%)","2,575 (30%)","1,120 (13%)",343 (4%),201 (2%)
Asleep in the Sun,Adolfo Bioy Casares,3.90,"1,639 rating","January 1, 1973","Lucio, a normal man in a normal (nosy) city neighborhood with normal problems with his in-laws (ever-present) and job (he lost it) finds he has a new problem on his hands: his beloved wife, Diana. She’s been staying out till all hours of the night and grows more disagreeable by the day. Should Lucio have Diana committed to the Psychiatric Institute, as her friend the dog trainer suggests? Before Lucio can even make up his mind, Diana is carted away by the mysterious head of the institute. Never mind, Diana’s sister, who looks just like Diana—and yet is nothing like her—has moved in. And on the recommendation of the dog trainer, Lucio acquires an adoring German shepherd, also named Diana. Then one glorious day, Diana returns, affectionate and pleasant. She’s been cured!—but have the doctors at the institute gone too far?Asleep in the Sun is the great work of the Argentine master Adolfo Bioy Casares's later years. Like his legendary Invention of Morel, it is an intoxicating mixture of fantasy, sly humor, and menace. Whether read as a fable of modern politics, a meditation on the elusive parameters of the self, or a most unusual love story, Bioy's book is an almost scarily perfect comic turn, as well as a pure delight.",172,220,743 follower,"['Fiction', 'Latin American', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Spanish Literature', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Latin American', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Spanish Literature', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Latin American', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Spanish Literature', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Latin American', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Spanish Literature', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Latin American', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Spanish Literature', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction']",177 review,446 (27%),703 (42%),388 (23%),85 (5%),17 (1%)

The Widow of Ratchets,Owen Brookes,3.91,34 rating,"January 1, 1979","Here is a gothic tale in the finest tradition of Thomas Tryon, Victoria Holt, and Phyllis Whitney-an auspicious debut for Owen Brookes.The Widow of Ratchets tells the slightly supernatural and highly ominous story of American Lyndsay Kramer Dolben, an attractive newlywed who arrives in England to rejoin her husband only to be immediately informed of his recent death. Overcome with grief, the young widow travels to Ratchets, the remote village where Michael's family has lived for centuries. But even before the funeral arrangements are completed, Lyndsay begins to suspect that the traditions of the town and its inhabitants, especially their unorthodox reverence for the Land, are frightening and peculiar. The unraveling of these ancient and bloody fertility rituals and incestuous primitive taboos keeps her intellectually and emotionally occupied for the remainder of this awesome and gripping story. Through Lyndsay's eyes and actions we come to understand the formidable powers of the earth. Owen Brookes has written a masterful tour de force, an occult novel at once seductive and authentic, in character and plot.Owen Brooks, who lives and teaches in London, is the author of several works of nonfiction. The Widow of Ratchets is his first novel.",320,6,6 book,"['Horror', 'Gothic', 'Fiction']",8 review,10 (29%),14 (41%),7 (20%),3 (8%),0 (0%)
Execution by Hunger: The Hidden Holocaust,Miron Dolot,4.28,467 rating,"September 25, 1985","Seven million people in the ""breadbasket of Europe"" were deliberately starved to death at Stalin's command. This story has been suppressed for half a century. Now, a survivor speaks. In 1929, in an effort to destroy the well-to-do peasant farmers, Joseph Stalin ordered the collectivization of all Ukrainian farms. In the ensuing years, a brutal Soviet campaign of confiscations, terrorizing, and murder spread throughout Ukrainian villages. What food remained after the seizures was insufficient to support the population. In the resulting famine as many as seven million Ukrainians starved to death.This poignant eyewitness account of the Ukrainian famine by one of the survivors relates the young Miron Dolot's day-to-day confrontation with despair and death―his helplessness as friends and family were arrested and abused―and his gradual realization, as he matured, of the absolute control the Soviets had over his life and the lives of his people. But it is also the story of personal dignity in the face of horror and humiliation. And it is an indictment of a chapter in the Soviet past that is still not acknowledged by Russian leaders.",248,6,5 follower,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Holocaust', 'Soviet Union', 'Russian History']",60 review,224 (47%),173 (37%),54 (11%),11 (2%),5 (1%)
