Son père, un commerçant, ayant reçu une éducation militaire (famille militaire), totalement psychorigide, qui a commis un péché dans sa jeunesse à Paris et avec qui il entretient des rapports tendus, veut qu'il devienne prêtre pour expier les fautes que lui-même a commises. Rudolf croit en Dieu, jusqu'au jour où, en se battant avec un de ses camarades d'école (Werner), il lui casse la jambe. Immédiatement, il va se confesser à un prêtre. Le soir même, son père devient fou de rage après avoir appris que son fils a commis un « péché » sans lui en parler. Rudolf se sent trahi par le prêtre, seule personne au courant de l'épisode, les autres croyant à un accident. Or, on apprendra que c'est en fait le père de l'enfant blessé qui s'est plaint devant une assemblée de parents d'élèves. Le mal est fait : Rudolf ne croit plus en Dieu. Son père meurt peu avant la déclaration de guerre en 1914.À seize ans, Lang débute sa carrière militaire, d'abord en partant directement pour le front Ouest où il sera intercepté puis renvoyé à l'arrière car il est trop jeune, puis comme aide à l'hôpital militaire où il rencontrera un dragon de cavalerie qui le persuadera de rentrer dans son unité et de partir sur le front en Turquie.À la fin de la guerre, il se retrouve au chômage, rejeté par sa famille. Il s'apprête à se suicider lorsqu'un de ses collègues arrive et lui brandit un tract en lui disant de ne pas trahir l'Allemagne en se donnant la mort.Il adhère au parti nazi et se voit confier la direction d'une ferme avec sa femme Elsie, où il vit des journées de dur labeur, mais paisibles. Puis, après la prise du pouvoir par Hitler, il entre dans les SS, n'ayant pourtant pas les critères requis pour y adhérer. Il accède à des fonctions de plus en plus importantes dans la hiérarchie SS, jusqu'à devenir commandant du camp d'Auschwitz. Ce camp, d'abord de concentration, puis d'extermination, devient le lieu de la lente et tâtonnante mise au point de l'Usine de Mort du village d'Auschwitz. Il y reçoit l'ordre du Reichsführer Himmler de supprimer 500 000 unités par an au lieu des ridicules 80 000 unités de Treblinka. Lang va s'attacher à accomplir la mission qui lui a été assignée : tuer le plus grand nombre de Juifs et éliminer le plus efficacement possible les cadavres. Après la guerre et la chute d'Hitler, il est emprisonné, puis condamné à la pendaison après son procès où il affirmera avoir seulement suivi les ordres, indiquant d'un air naturel qu'il a supervisé et participé activement au meurtre de « seulement » 2,5 millions de personnes au lieu des 3,5 millions prévus3.Tout au long du livre, il se montre incapable de sentiments et même d'action personnelle, car sa conduite lui a toujours été dictée par un chef en qui il portait une confiance totale. À la fin, on le sent cependant en colère se disant trahi par Himmler, qui, tel un lâche, s'est suicidé, et n'a ainsi pas voulu assumer son rôle dans l'extermination des Juifs, laissant Rudolf seul responsable de ses actes. Jusqu'au bout, il assume cependant son idée du chef, en répétant froidement et méthodiquement qu'il est le seul responsable de ce qui s'est passé à Auschwitz, et en énonçant sans difficulté les atrocités commises. Son seul moment de doute survient lorsque sa femme apprend ses activités, mais, ayant été choisi pour ses rares qualités de conscience il n'accorde pas d'importance à la morale.",416,104,236 follower,"['History', 'France', 'War', 'Classics', 'Historical', 'French Literature', 'World War II']",486 review,"3,401 (51%)","2,286 (34%)",727 (11%),109 (1%),35 (<1%)

Open Veins of Latin America: Five Centuries of the Pillage of a Continent,Eduardo Galeano,4.31,"22,638 rating","January 1, 1971","Since its U.S. debut almost fifty years ago, this brilliant text has set a new standard for historical scholarship of Latin America. It is also an outstanding political economy, a social and cultural narrative of the highest quality, and perhaps the finest description of primitive capital accumulation since Marx.Rather than chronology, geography, or political successions, Eduardo Galeano has organized the various facets of Latin American history according to the patterns of five centuries of exploitation. Thus he is concerned with gold and silver, cacao and cotton, rubber and coffee, fruit, hides and wool, petroleum, iron, nickel, manganese, copper, aluminum ore, nitrates, and tin. These are the veins which he traces through the body of the entire continent, up to the Rio Grande and throughout the Caribbean, and all the way to their open ends where they empty into the coffers of wealth in the United States and Europe.Weaving fact and imagery into a rich tapestry, Galeano fuses scientific analysis with the passions of a plundered and suffering people. An immense gathering of materials is framed with a vigorous style that never falters in its command of themes. All readers interested in great historical, economic, political, and social writing will find a singular analytical achievement, and an overwhelming narrative that makes history speak, unforgettably.This classic is now further honored by Isabel Allende’s inspiring introduction. Universally recognized as one of the most important writers of our time, Allende once again contributes her talents to literature, to political principles, and to enlightenment.",317,217,"3,390 follower","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'Latin American', 'Spanish Literature', 'Latin American History', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'Latin American', 'Spanish Literature', 'Latin American History', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'Latin American', 'Spanish Literature', 'Latin American History', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'Latin American', 'Spanish Literature', 'Latin American History', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'Latin American', 'Spanish Literature', 'Latin American History']","1,877 review","11,643 (51%)","7,385 (32%)","2,784 (12%)",603 (2%),223 (<1%)

At the editing table, when I run the strip of film through, frame by frame, I still feel that dizzy sense of magic of my childhood.” Bergman, who has conveyed this heady sense of wonder and vision to moviegoers for decades, traces his lifelong love affair with film in his breathtakingly visual autobiography, The Magic Lantern.More grand mosaic than linear account, Bergman’s vignettes trace his life from a rural Swedish childhood through his work in theater to Hollywood’s golden age, and a tumultuous romantic history that includes five wives and more than a few mistresses. Throughout, Bergman recounts his life in a series of deeply personal flashbacks that document some of the most important moments in twentieth-century filmmaking as well as the private obsessions of the man behind them. Ambitious in scope yet sensitively wrought, The Magic Lantern is a window to the mind of one of our era’s great geniuses.“[Bergman] has found a way to show the soul’s landscape . . . .

The Angel of Darkness,Caleb Carr,3.99,"29,570 rating","September 16, 1997","In The Angel of Darkness, Caleb Carr brings back the vivid world of his bestselling The Alienist but with a twist: this story is told by the former street urchin Stevie Taggert, whose rough life has given him wisdom beyond his years. Thus New York City, and the groundbreaking alienist Dr. Kreizler himself, are seen anew. It is June 1897. A year has passed since Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a pioneer in forensic psychiatry, tracked down the brutal serial killer John Beecham with the help of a team of trusted companions and a revolutionary application of the principles of his discipline. Kreizler and his friends--high-living crime reporter John Schuyler Moore; indomitable, derringer-toting Sara Howard; the brilliant (and bickering) detective brothers Marcus and Lucius Isaacson; powerful and compassionate Cyrus Montrose; and Stevie Taggert, the boy Kreizler saved from a life of street crime--have returned to their former pursuits and tried to forget the horror of the Beecham case. But when the distraught wife of a Spanish diplomat begs Sara's aid, the team reunites to help find her kidnapped infant daughter. It is a case fraught with danger, since Spain and the United States are on the verge of war. Once again, Caleb Carr proves his brilliant ability to re-create the past, both high life and low. As the horror unfolds, Delmonico's still serves up wondrous meals, and a summer trip to the elegant gambling parlors of Saratoga provides precious keys to the murderer's past. At the same time, we go on revealing journeys into Stevie's New York, a place where poor and neglected children--then as now--turn to crime and drugs at shockingly early ages. Peppered throughout are characters taken from real life and rendered with historical vigor, including suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton; painter Albert Pinkham Ryder; and Clarence Darrow, who thunders for the defense in a tense courtroom drama during which the sanctity of American motherhood itself is put on trial.

The Evolution Deceit: The Scientific Collapse of Darwinism and its Ideological Background,Harun Yahya,3.58,520 rating,"January 1, 1997","For some people the theory of evolution or Darwinism has only scientific connotations, with seemingly no direct implication in their daily lives. This is, of course, a common misunderstanding. Far beyond just being an issue within the framework of the biological sciences, the theory of evolution constitutes the underpinning of a deceptive philosophy that has held sway over a large number of Materialism. Materialist philosophy, which accepts only the existence of matter and presupposes man to be 'a heap of matter', asserts that he is no more than an animal, with 'conflict' the sole rule of his existence. Although propagated as a modern philosophy based on science, materialism is in fact an ancient dogma with no scientific basis. Conceived in Ancient Greece, the dogma was rediscovered by the atheistic philosophers of the 18th century. It was then implanted in the 19th century into several science disciplines by thinkers such as Karl Marx, Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud. In other words science was distorted to make room for materialism. The past two centuries have been a bloody arena of Ideologies based on materialism (or competing ideologies arguing against materialism, yet sharing its basic tenets) have brought permanent violence, war and chaos to the world. Communism, responsible for the death of 120 million people, is the direct outcome of materialistic philosophy. Fascism, despite pretending to be an alternative to the materialistic world-view, accepted the fundamental materialist concept of progress though conflict and sparked off oppressive regimes, massacres, world wars and genocide. Besides these two bloody ideologies, individual and social ethics have also been corrupted by materialism. The deceptive message of materialism, reducing man to an animal whose existence is coincidental and with no responsibility to any being, demolished moral pillars such as love, mercy, self-sacrifice, modesty, honesty and justice. Having been misled by the materialists' motto ""life is a struggle"", people came to see their lives as nothing more than a clash of interests which, in turn, led to life according to the law of the jungle. Traces of this philosophy, which has a lot to answer as regards man-made disasters of the last two centuries, can be found in every ideology that perceives differences among people as a 'reason for conflict'. That includes the terrorists of the present day who claim to uphold religion, yet commit one of the greatest sins by murdering innocent people. Karl Marx made it clear that Darwin's theory provided a solid ground for materialism and thus also for communism. He also showed his sympathy to Darwin by dedicating Das Kapital, which is considered as his greatest work, to him. In the German edition of the book, he ""From a devoted admirer to Charles Darwin"" The theory of evolution, or Darwinism, comes in handy at this point by completing the jigsaw puzzle. It provides the myth that materialism is a scientific idea. That is why, Karl Marx, the founder of communism and dialectical materialism, wrote that Darwinism was ""the basis in natural history"" for his worldview.1 However, that basis is rotten. Modern scientific discoveries reveal over and over again that the popular belief associating Darwinism with science is false. Scientific evidence refutes Darwinism comprehensively and reveals that the origin of our existence is not evolution but creation. God has created the universe, all living things and man. This book has been written to make this fact known to people. Since its first publication, originally in Turkey and then in many other countries, millions of people have read and appreciated the book. In addition to Turkish, it has been printed in English, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Bosnian, Arabic, Malay and Indonesian.

Shade, the lost baby bat of the first book, has rejoined his colony only to lose his freedom as the bats plunge into a mysterious human building they believe is paradise. The building's vast interior forest, with its teeming insects and eerie absence of owls, certainly seems like Eden. But Shade and his Brightwing friend Marina, now young adults, discover that the humans have a sinister motive for befriending the bats--they are using them as unwitting suicide bombers over a jungle war zone.  In addition, the bats are threatened once again by Goth, the giant jungle bat with the cannibalistic tastes and irrepressible knack for survival of Hannibal Lecter. This time he has a plan for making his god, Zotz, supreme: to be explicit (and Oppel is), by ripping out the hearts of 100 imprisoned bats, owls, and rats. Shade's and Marina's race to save their companions from this two-pronged threat makes for exciting and occasionally terrifying reading.        Once again Oppel immerses readers in the world view of his tiny flying mammals. It becomes second nature to see things upside down, hide in crevices, squint at the brightness of the sun, and sense danger through sound vibrations. Particularly chilling is his portrayal of the humans' laboratory, with its concentration-camp-like indifference to life.

She offers a rethinking of self-love (without narcissism) that will bring peace and compassion to our personal and professional lives, and asserts the place of love to end struggles between individuals, in communities, and among societies. Moving from the cultural to the intimate, hooks notes the ties between love and loss and challenges the prevailing notion that romantic love is the most important love of all.Visionary and original, hooks shows how love heals the wounds we bear as individuals and as a nation, for it is the cornerstone of compassion and forgiveness and holds the power to overcome shame.For readers who have found ongoing delight and wisdom in bell hooks's life and work, and for those who are just now discovering her, All About Love is essential reading and a brilliant book that will change how we think about love, our culture-and one another.",240,131,11k follower,"['Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Essays', 'Love', 'Psychology']","10,370 review","32,801 (39%)","28,398 (34%)","15,489 (18%)","4,446 (5%)",979 (1%)

The essays were written during a difficult time in Twain's life; he was deep in debt and had lost his wife and one of his daughters. The book consists of a series of short stories, many of which deal with God and Christianity. Twain penned a series of letters from the point-of-view of a dejected angel on Earth. This title story consists of letters written by the archangel Satan to archangels, Gabriel and Michael, about his observations on the curious proceedings of earthly life and the nature of man's religions. By analyzing the idea of heaven and God that is widely accepted by those who believe in both, Twain is able to take the silliness that is present and study it with the common sense that is absent. Not so much an attack as much as a cold dissection. Other short stories in the book include a bedtime story about a family of cats Twain wrote for his daughters, and an essay explaining why an anaconda is morally superior to Man.
