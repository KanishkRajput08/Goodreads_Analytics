"Two Old Women: An Alaskan Legend of Betrayal, Courage and Survival",Velma Wallis,4.08,"15,172 rating","January 1, 1993","Based on an Athabascan Indian legend passed along for many generations from mothers to daughters of the upper Yukon River Valley in Alaska, this is the suspenseful, shocking, ultimately inspirational tale of two old women abandoned by their tribe during a brutal winter famine.Though these women have been known to complain more than contribute, they now must either survive on their own or die trying. In simple but vivid detail, Velma Wallis depicts a landscape and way of life that are at once merciless and starkly beautiful. In her old women, she has created two heroines of steely determination whose story of betrayal, friendship, community and forgiveness ""speaks straight to the heart with clarity, sweetness and wisdom"" (Ursula K. Le Guin).",140,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Survival', 'Historical', 'Mythology', 'Folklore']",123 follower,"2,171 review",14,101 (<1%),497 (3%),"2,932 (19%)","6,274 (41%)","5,368 (35%)"

McKibben's argument that the survival of the globe is dependent on a fundamental, philosophical shift in the way we relate to nature is more relevant than ever. McKibben writes of our earth's environmental cataclysm, addressing such core issues as the greenhouse effect, acid rain, and the depletion of the ozone layer. His new introduction addresses some of the latest environmental issues that have risen during the 1990s. The book also includes an invaluable new appendix of facts and figures that surveys the progress of the environmental movement.More than simply a handbook for survival or a doomsday catalog of scientific prediction, this classic, soulful lament on Nature is required reading for nature enthusiasts, activists, and concerned citizens alike.",224,"['Nonfiction', 'Environment', 'Science', 'Nature', 'Climate Change', 'Ecology', 'Sustainability']",752 follower,191 review,215,51 (1%),150 (5%),672 (22%),"1,175 (39%)",948 (31%)

Παραμύθι χωρίς όνομα,Penelope Delta,4.15,"1,884 rating","January 1, 1910","Το ""Παραμύθι χωρίς όνομα"" γράφτηκε σε μια εποχή πολιτικά ταραγμένη για την Ελλάδα. Η ήττα του 1897 ήταν ακόμα νωπή, το καθεστώς ασταθές, άνθιζε η διαφθορά, η εκπαίδευση δεν ανταποκρινόταν στις ευρωπαϊκές αντιλήψεις περί παιδαγωγικής. Από την άλλη, το γλωσσικό ζήτημα έκαιγε. Ο Εκπαιδευτικός Όμιλος, του οποίου ήταν μέλος και η Δέλτα, συσπείρωνε διανοούμενους, όπως λογοτέχνες (Βάρναλης, Καζαντζάκης, Νιρβάνας), εκπαιδευτικούς και παιδαγωγούς (Γληνός, Δελμούζος) φιλολόγους (Σαρής, Τριανταφυλλίδης), με στόχο μεταρρυθμίσεις που αφορούσαν στην εισαγωγή της δημοτικής γλώσσας στην εκπαίδευση και στην εξάπλωση νέων ιδεών για την ανατροφή των παιδιών.ΜΑΡΙΖΑ ΝΤΕΚΑΣΤΡΟΤο ""Παραμύθι χωρίς όνομα"" είναι ένα πολιτικό παραμύθι, είναι μια πλατωνική Πολιτεία για παιδιά, είναι η ιστορία μιας παραμυθένιας πατρίδας... Της Ελλάδας.Η Πηνελόπη Δ. είναι πιστή, όπως τ' όνομά της, στις ιδέες της μέσα στο βιβλίο, πιστή μέχρι το θάνατο σ'όλα όσα επέλεξε να ξεχάσει και σ' αυτά που τόσο μεθοδικά προτείνει.Τα ονόματα των πρωταγωνιστών τούς ανήκουν εκ φύσεως και διηγούνται κι από μόνα τους την ιστορία. Ο καλός βασιλιάς, που μετρήθηκαν οι μέρες του, λέγεται Συνετός, και μετά αρχίζει η βασιλεία του Αστόχαστου και της Παλάβως στη Χώρα των Μοιρολάτρων. Μέχρι που, από τη γειτονική χώρα, φτάνει, αντί για οικονομική βοήθεια, η ύστατη προσβολή: μια γαϊδουροκεφαλή με τενεκεδένιο στέμμα.Κι εδώ ακριβώς αρχίζει το παραμύθι για τα απογοητευμένα μάτια μας. Ο γιος του Αστόχαστου λέγεται Συνετός Β΄ και αρκεί να πούμε ότι στο τέλος θα παντρευτεί τη Γνώση, κόρη της Φρόνησης, λες κι έχει πάρει το αξίωμά του κατευθείαν από τον Σωκράτη.Ξαναδιαβάζοντας το βιβλίο, ένας μεγάλος θα νιώσει ίσως αμήχανα στις μέρες μας, αντιμέτωπος μ'αυτή την ελπίδα που δεν διαψεύδεται και με την αρετή που ξαναχτίζει τον κόσμο - χωρίς καθόλου μαγικά ξόρκια ή δανεικά κονδύλια, αλλά χάρη σε πολύ σκληρή δουλειά για το κοινό καλό. Γιατί ένας μεγάλος αυτόματα θα μετρήσει την απόσταση ανάμεσα σ' αυτά που επέλεξε να υποτιμήσει και να ξεχάσει και στα τόσα που μεθοδικά προτείνει το βιβλίο. Γιατί η Πηνελόπη Δ. έχει προβλέψει ακόμα και για τη σωστή εκμετάλλευση της φύσης, έχει σκεφτεί ακόμα και τους φυλακισμένους να ξανακάνει ανθρώπους μέσα από την πιο σκληρή, είναι η αλήθεια, δουλειά των λατομείων. Και παρόλο που δεν ξεφεύγει από την παρουσία μιας ελέω Θεού βασιλικής οικογένειας, το βασιλόπουλο είναι τόσο ταπεινό, εργατικό και ενάρετο που θα μπορούσε να είναι ένας αυτοδημιούργητος λαϊκός ήρωας.ΜΑΡΙΑ ΜΗΤΣΟΡΑΗ Πηνελόπη Δέλτα φώτισε τα παιδικά μας χρόνια, τα κατοίκησε και τα ενθάρρυνε δίνοντας ""όνομα"" -και μια σπάνια αύρα- στα ανείπωτα της ψυχής.

The Little Town Where Time Stood Still (F): A Novel,Bohumil Hrabal,3.92,"1,252 rating","January 1, 1974","Includes The Little Town Where Time Stood Still and Cutting It Short.In the 1930s Europe is tangoing to the tune of a new age, but in rural Czechoslovakia Maryska dances to a rhythm all her own. In a town dominated by a somber municipal brewery, she is a colorful and rather alarming apparition speeding through the quiet village on her bicycle, her long, tempestuous hair billowing behind her. Not even her husband, Francin (the brewery manager), can control her, as Maryska shocks the populace with her scandalous behavior, and incurs the disapproval of a proper little town that is blissfully unaware of the cataclysmic world events into which it is about to be engulfed. As World War II draws to a close and communism looms on the horizon, Maryska and her town appear to have survived unscathed. But subtle changes begin to appear - in Maryska and her family, and most noticeably at the brewery, where the new political order creates tensions that tear through the social fabric of the town in ways that Maryska in her wildest days could not possibly have imagined. The two linked narratives brought together in The Little Town Where Time Stood Still comprise Bohumil Hrabal's poignant and witty evocation of the passing of an era and display a master writer at the height of his powers as he creates, in an enchanting fictional work, an elegy for a nation that is no more.",302,"['Czech Literature', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Czech Literature', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Czech Literature', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Czech Literature', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Czech Literature', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction']","1,170 follower",128 review,181,23 (1%),67 (5%),295 (23%),473 (37%),394 (31%)

The Case for Mars,Robert Zubrin,4.11,"2,846 rating","November 8, 1996","Leading space exploration authority Robert Zubrin has crafted a daring new blueprint, Mars Direct, that experts are hailing as the most visionary and pragmatic step toward expanding human activity in space since the Apollo Moon landings. Presented here with illustrations, photographs, and engaging anecdotes, Dr. Zubrin's plan will revive our hopes and dreams and convince us that other worlds can be reached - affordably and within our lifetime.Unlike the dead world of the Moon, the Martian landscape abounds with ancient canyons, dried river beds, the remains of frozen polar oceans, and enormous ice caps. The possibilities for exploration and discovery are nearly limitless; but significant exploration of Mars can only occur on her surface, and in order to do that we must be able to survive there. In the great tradition of human exploration, Dr. Zubrin's plan calls for a travel-light and live-off-the-land approach. He explains step-by-step how we can use present-day technology to send humans to Mars within ten years; actually produce fuel and oxygen on the planet's surface with Martian natural resources; how we can build bases and settlements; and how we can one day ""terraform"" Mars - a process that can alter the atmosphere of planets and pave the way for sustainable life.Under Dr. Zubrin's program, a human mission is only the first step toward a day when research bases and eventual colonies can be developed on Mars' surface. Mars possesses enormous chemical and mineral resources, all of which can be put to use in pursuit of travel, exploration, structures, and a variety of human activities on a planet that is neither as harsh nor as unreachable as we popularly believe.The Case For Mars is not a vision for the far future or one that will cost us impossible billions. It is a plan that can be put into action today if we are willing to rethink our traditional methods and costs. Zubrin maps out how the use of Martian resources, innovations, streamlined approaches, and a series of manageable government grants coupled with the efforts of private enterprise can make repeated humans-to-Mars missions possible.",368,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Space', 'Astronomy', 'Engineering', 'Technology', 'Politics']",140 follower,208 review,35,31 (1%),129 (4%),476 (16%),"1,068 (37%)","1,142 (40%)"

Dreamtigers,Jorge Luis Borges,4.16,"4,479 rating","January 1, 1960"," Dreamtigers has been heralded as one of the literary masterpieces of the twentieth century by Mortimer J. Adler, editor of Great Books of the Western World. It has been acknowledged by its author as his most personal work. Composed of poems, parables, and stories, sketches and apocryphal quotations, Dreamtigers at first glance appears to be a sampleralbeit a dazzling oneof the master's work. Upon closer examination, however, the reader discovers the book to be a subtly and organically unified self-revelation.   Dreamtigers explores the mysterious territory that lies between the dreams of the creative artist and the ""real"" world. The central vision of the work is that of a recluse in the ""enveloping serenity "" of a library, looking ahead to the time when he will have disappeared but in the timeless world of his books will continue his dialogue with the immortals of the past  Homer, Don Quixote, Shakespeare. Like Homer, the maker of these dreams is afflicted with failing sight. Still, he dreams of tigers real and imagined, and reflects upon of a life that, above all, has been intensely introspective, a life of calm self-possession and absorption in the world of the imagination. At the same time he is keenly aware of that other Borges, the public figure about whom he reads with mixed emotions: ""It's the other one, it's Borges, that things happen to.""

Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland,Christopher R. Browning,4.10,"19,244 rating","February 1, 1992","Christopher R. Browning’s shocking account of how a unit of average middle-aged Germans became the cold-blooded murderers of tens of thousands of Jews—now with a new afterword and additional photographs. Ordinary Men is the true story of Reserve Police Battalion 101 of the German Order Police, which was responsible for mass shootings as well as round-ups of Jewish people for deportation to Nazi death camps in Poland in 1942. Browning argues that most of the men of RPB 101 were not fanatical Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition.  Ordinary Men is a powerful, chilling, and important work, with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.  ",271,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Holocaust', 'Psychology', 'War', 'World War II', 'Historical']",133 follower,"1,427 review",32,207 (1%),619 (3%),"3,393 (17%)","7,835 (40%)","7,190 (37%)"

Walking to Mercury takes readers back to the 20th century and powerfully dramatizes the forces that shaped this extraordinary woman.The book opens and closes with the middle-aged Maya struggling with a profound personal and spiritual crisis. The culminating factor has been her mother's death, and now Maya embarks on a trek in the Himalayas, intending to sprinkle her mother's ashes at the base of Mt. Everest and finally lay to rest her tumultuous past. At rest stops in tiny Tibetan villages, she reads diary pages her lover Johanna has tucked into her bag—the diary Johanna kept throughout their shared youth during the Vietnam era.In vivid flashbacks to those radical days, we accompany the young Maya as she awakens to the summer of love, joins the anti-war movement, and enters into a relationship with the abusive, alcoholic Rio. She finally gathers the strength to break free and seek her own true path, which takes her from the streets of Manhattan to the mountains of Mexico. Eventually she emerges, stronger and wiser, infused with the wisdom of the earth and the spirit of the goddess.

En la novela, el medio geográfico y social parece determinar de modo decisivo el ser y el existir de sus criaturas; el destino parece jugar con esos personajes, pobres lugareños aferrados al terruño, vivos y elementales, que defienden rabiosamente su libertad y constituyen un retablo de cruda y palpitante humanidad. Entre ellos surge poderosamente la figura del Ratero, y sobre todo la del Nini, niño que vive sufriendo e intenta rebelarse contra la sordidez que le rodea; pero su rebeldía es callada, dulce, sin vanidad, y le levanta a la altura de símbolo: el bien contra el mal, el candor contra la astucia... El drama sera inevitable, pero la tragedia —ha dicho un crítico— «está contada de la manera sencilla con que las tragedias se abaten sobre el hombre en la vida: sin demasía, sin melodrama, sin aspavientos».Miguel Delibes nació en Valladolid en 1920. Cursó las carreras de Derecho y Comercio. Se reveló como novelista al obtener el Premio Nadal en 1947 con La sombra de ciprés es alargada, su primera novela.

Kafka wrote in the tradition of the great Yiddish storytellers, whose stock-in-trade was bizarre fantasy tainted with hilarity and self-abasement. What he added to this tradition was an almost unbearably expanded consciousness.

David Zane Mairowitz's brilliant text and the illustrations and comic panels of the world's greatest cartoonist, Robert Crumb (himself no stranger to self-loathing and alienation), help us to understand the essence of Kafka and provide insight beyond the cliche ""Kafkaesque,"" peering through Kafka's glass wall like no other book before it.

Peace Shall Destroy Many,Rudy Wiebe,3.74,296 rating,"January 1, 1972","In 1944, as war rages across Europe and Asia, famine, violence and fear are commonplace. But life appears tranquil in the isolated farming settlement of Wapiti in northern Saskatchewan, where the Mennonite community continues the agricultural lifestyle their ancestors have practised for centuries. Their Christian values of peace and love lead them to oppose war and military service, so they are hardly affected by the war – except for the fact that they are reaping the rewards of selling their increasingly valuable crops and livestock.Thom Wiens, a young farmer and earnest Christian, begins to ask questions. How can they claim to oppose the war when their livestock become meat to sustain soldiers? How can they enjoy this free country but rely on others to fight to preserve that freedom? Within the community, conflicts and broken relationships threaten the peace, as the Mennonite tradition of close community life manifests itself as racism toward their “half-breed” neighbours, and aspirations of holiness turn into condemnation of others. Perhaps the greatest hope for the future lies with children such as Hal Wiens, whose friendship with the Métis children and appreciation of the natural environment offer a positive vision of people living at peace with themselves and others.Wiebe’s groundbreaking first novel aroused great controversy among Mennonite communities when it was first published in 1962. Wiebe explains, “I guess it was a kind of bombshell because it was the first realistic novel ever written about Mennonites in western Canada. A lot of people had no clue how to read it. They got angry. I was talking from the inside and exposing things that shouldn't be exposed.” At the same time, other reviewers were unsure how to react to Wiebe’s explicitly religious themes, a view which Wiebe found absurd. “There are many, many people who feel that religious experience is the most vital thing that happens to them in their lives, and how many of these people actually ever get explored in modern novels?”The concept of peace is an important theme in Wiebe’s first three books. The attempt to live non-violently, one of the basic tenets of the Mennonite faith as taught by the sixteenth-century spiritual leader Menno Simons, is what has “caused the Mennonites the most difficulty in their relationship with everybody,” forcing them to move again and again. The theme of peace versus passivity is further explored in The Blue Mountains of China, where inner peace, a state of being, is contrasted with the earthly desire for a place of public order and tranquility where the church is “there for a few hours a Sunday and maybe a committee meeting during the week to keep our fire escape polished,” as Thom, the protagonist puts it.. Wiebe has said, “To be an Anabaptist is to be a radical follower of the person of Jesus Christ . . . and Jesus Christ had no use for the social and political structures of his day; he came to supplant them.”While Peace Shall Destroy Many takes place in a Mennonite community, its elements are universal, delineating the way young idealism rebels against staid tradition, as a son clashes with his father. In the face of violent confrontations between beliefs all over the world, the novel remains as compelling now as it was nearly forty years ago.",320,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Canada', 'Spirituality', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Religion']",38 follower,38 review,39,10 (3%),19 (6%),72 (24%),133 (44%),62 (20%)

The Real George Washington: The True Story of America s Most Indispensable Man. There is properly no history; only biography, wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. If that is true of the general run of mankind, it is particularly true of George Washington. The story of his life is the story of the founding of America. His was the dominant personality in three of the most critical events in that founding: the Revolutionary War, the Constitutional Convention, and the first national administration. Had he not served as America's leader in those three events, all would likely have failed -- and America, as we know it today, would not exist. Why, after two centuries, does George Washington remain one of the most beloved figures in our history? The Real George Washington answers that question by giving us a close look at this man who became the father of our country and the first American President. But rather than focus on the interpretations of historians, much of his exciting story is told in his own words. The second part of this 928-page book brings together the most important and insightful passages from Washington's writings, conveniently arranged by subject.

With the help of Marta, her enigmatic neighbor, the narrator accumulates these stories, tracing the history of Nowa Ruda from the its founding to the lives of its saints, from the caller who wins the radio quiz every day to the man who causes international tension when he dies straddling the border between Poland and Czechoslovakia.Each of the stories represents a brick and they interlock to reveal the immense monument that is the town.

The Beginning of Spring,Penelope Fitzgerald,3.74,"3,054 rating","January 1, 1988","In March 1913, Frank Reid's wife abruptly leaves him and Moscow for her native England. Naturally, she takes their daughters and son with her. The children, however, only make it as far as the train station - and even after returning home remain unaffected by their brief exile. ""They ought either to be quieter or more noisy than before,"" their father thinks, ""and it was disconcerting that they seemed to be exactly the same."" Frank's routines, however, drift into disorder as he tries desperately to take charge of life at home and work. Even his printing plant is suddenly confronted by the specters of modernization and utter instability. In Penelope Fitzgerald's fiction, affection and remorse are all too often allied, and desire and design seem never to meet. Frank wants little more than a quiet, confident life - something for which he is deeply unsuited, and which Russia certainly will not go out of her way to provide. 'The Beginning of Spring' is filled with echoes of past wrongs and whispers of the revolution to come, even if the author evokes these with abrupt comic brio. (In one disturbance, ""A great many shots had hit people for whom they were not intended."") As ever, Fitzgerald makes us care for - and want to know ever more about - her characters, even the minor players. Her two-page description of Frank's chief type compositor, for instance, is a miracle of precision and humor, sympathy and mystery. And the accountant Selwyn Crane - a Tolstoy devotée, self-published poet, and expert at making others feel guilty -is a sublime creation. His appetite for do-gooding is insatiable. After one fit of apparent altriusm, ""Selwyn subsided. Now that he saw everything was going well, his mind was turning to his next charitable enterprise. With the terrible aimlessness of the benevolent, he was casting round for a new misfortune."" As she evokes her household of tears and laughter, Fitzgerald's prose is as witty as ever, rendering the past present and the modern timeless. - Kerry Fried",188,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Russia', 'Literary Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Classics']",672 follower,382 review,46,69 (2%),260 (8%),833 (27%),"1,136 (37%)",756 (24%)

The early attempts at this reincarnation—masterminded by the sinister Duke Mardus and his sorcerous minion Vargul Ashnazai—once left Seregil in a sorcerous coma. Now, an ancient prophecy points to his continuing role in the quest to stop Mardus in his dread purpose.

In a secret, silver-lined room hidden well beneath the Oreska, he has served for most of his 300 years as the keeper of a nondescript clay cup.
