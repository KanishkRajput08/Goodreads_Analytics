Pedagogy of the Oppressed,Paulo Freire,4.30,"34,212 rating","January 1, 1968","First published in Portuguese in 1968, Pedagogy of the Oppressed was translated and published in English in 1970. The methodology of the late Paulo Freire has helped to empower countless impoverished and illiterate people throughout the world. Freire's work has taken on especial urgency in the United States and Western Europe, where the creation of a permanent underclass among the underprivileged and minorities in cities and urban centers is increasingly accepted as the norm. With a substantive new introduction on Freire's life and the remarkable impact of this book by writer and Freire confidant and authority Donaldo Macedo, this anniversary edition of Pedagogy of the Oppressed will inspire a new generation of educators, students, and general readers for years to come.",183,145,"1,214 follower","['Education', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Theory', 'Social Justice', 'Teaching', 'Education', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Theory', 'Social Justice', 'Teaching', 'Education', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Theory', 'Social Justice', 'Teaching', 'Education', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Theory', 'Social Justice', 'Teaching', 'Education', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Theory', 'Social Justice', 'Teaching']","2,315 review","18,171 (53%)","10,194 (29%)","4,243 (12%)","1,118 (3%)",486 (1%)
Murder at the Vicarage,Agatha Christie,4.05,"187,489 rating","October 1, 1930","‘Anyone who murdered Colonel Protheroe,’ declared the parson, brandishing a carving knife above a joint of roast beef, ‘would be doing the world at large a favour!’ It was a careless remark for a man of the cloth.

Factotum,Charles Bukowski,3.93,"69,469 rating","January 1, 1975","One of Bukowski's best, this beer-soaked, deliciously degenerate novel follows the wanderings of aspiring writer Henry Chinaski across World War II-era America. Deferred from military service, Chinaski travels from city to city, moving listlessly from one odd job to another, always needing money but never badly enough to keep a job. His day-to-day existence spirals into an endless litany of pathetic whores, sordid rooms, dreary embraces, and drunken brawls, as he makes his bitter, brilliant way from one drink to the next.Charles Bukowski's posthumous legend continues to grow. Factotum is a masterfully vivid evocation of slow-paced, low-life urbanity and alcoholism, and an excellent introduction to the fictional world of Charles Bukowski.",208,786,27.7k follower,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'American', 'Poetry', 'Contemporary']","2,613 review","20,973 (30%)","28,326 (40%)","15,500 (22%)","3,565 (5%)","1,105 (1%)"

Giants in the Earth,O.E. Rølvaag,4.03,"5,765 rating","January 1, 1925","Giants in the Earth (Norwegian: Verdens Grøde) is a novel by Norwegian-American author Ole Edvart Rølvaag. First published in Norway as two books in 1924 and 1925, the author collaborated with Minnesotan Lincoln Colcord on the English translation.The novel follows a Norwegian family's struggles as they try to make a new life as pioneers in the Dakota territory. Rølvaag is interested in psychology and the human cost of empire building, at a time when other writers focused on the glamor and romance of the West. The book reflects his personal experiences as a settler as well as the immigrant homesteader experience of his wife’s family. Both the grim realities of pioneering and the gloomy fatalism of the Norse mind are captured in depictions of snow storms, locusts, poverty, hunger, loneliness, homesickness, the difficulty of fitting into a new culture, and the estrangement of immigrant children who grow up in a new land. It is a novel at once palpably European and distinctly American.Giants in the Earth was turned into an opera by Douglas Moore and Arnold Sundgaard; it won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1951.",531,20,44 follower,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Scandinavian Literature']",619 review,"2,180 (37%)","2,108 (36%)","1,059 (18%)",290 (5%),128 (2%)
Texas,James A. Michener,4.10,"18,458 rating","January 1, 1985","Spanning four and a half centuries, James A. Michener’s monumental saga chronicles the epic history of Texas, from its Spanish roots in the age of the conquistadors to its current reputation as one of America’s most affluent, diverse, and provocative states. Among his finely drawn cast of characters, emotional and political alliances are made and broken, as the loyalties established over the course of each turbulent age inevitably collapse under the weight of wealth and industry. With Michener as our guide, Texas is a tale of patriotism and statesmanship, growth and development, violence and betrayal—a stunning achievement by a literary master.  Praise for Texas   “Fascinating.”—Time   “A book about oil and water, rangers and outlaws, frontier and settlement, money and power . . .

Palace Walk introduces us to his gentle, oppressed wife, Amina, his cloistered daughters, Aisha and Khadija, and his three sons–the tragic and idealistic Fahmy, the dissolute hedonist Yasin, and the soul-searching intellectual Kamal. Al-Sayyid Ahmad’s rebellious children struggle to move beyond his domination in Palace of Desire, as the world around them opens to the currents of modernity and political and domestic turmoil brought by the 1920s. Sugar Street brings Mahfouz’s vivid tapestry of an evolving Egypt to a dramatic climax as the aging patriarch sees one grandson become a Communist, one a Muslim fundamentalist, and one the lover of a powerful politician.Throughout the trilogy, the family's trials mirror those of their turbulent country during the years spanning the two World Wars, as change comes to a society that has resisted it for centuries.

On a rafting trip down the Colorado River, Hayduke joins forces with feminist saboteur Bonnie Abbzug, wilderness guide Seldom Seen Smith, and billboard torcher Doc Sarvis, M.D., and together they wander off to wage war on the big yellow machines, on dam builders and road builders and strip miners.

What did Jesus mean to say to us? What is his will for us today? Drawing on the Sermon on the Mount, Dietrich Bonhoeffer answers these timeless questions by providing a seminal reading of the dichotomy between ""cheap grace"" and ""costly grace."" ""Cheap grace,"" Bonhoeffer wrote, ""is the grace we bestow on ourselves...grace without discipleship....Costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again, the girl which must be asked for, the door at which a man must know....It is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life.""The Cost of Discipleship is a compelling statement of the demands of sacrifice and ethical consistency from a man whose life and thought were exemplary articulations of a new type of leadership inspired by the Gospel, and imbued with the spirit of Christian humanism and a creative sense of civic duty.",320,315,"1,488 follower","['Christian', 'Theology', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Faith', 'Christian Living', 'Christian', 'Theology', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Faith', 'Christian Living', 'Christian', 'Theology', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Faith', 'Christian Living']","1,610 review","23,853 (53%)","13,241 (29%)","4,996 (11%)","1,441 (3%)",959 (2%)

Moses built an empire and lived like an emperor. He personally conceived and completed public works costing 27 billion dollars--the greatest builder America (and probably the world) has ever known. Without ever having been elected to office, he dominated the men who were--even his most bitter enemy, Franklin D.

For eons, sandstorms have swept the desolate landscape. For centuries, Mars has beckoned humans to conquer its hostile climate. Now, in 2026, a group of 100 colonists is about to fulfill that destiny. John Boone, Maya Toitavna, Frank Chalmers and Arkady Bogdanov lead a terraforming mission. For some, Mars will become a passion driving them to daring acts of courage and madness. For others it offers an opportunity to strip the planet of its riches. For the genetic alchemists, it presents a chance to create a biomedical miracle, a breakthrough that could change all we know about life and death. The colonists orbit giant satellite mirrors to reflect light to the surface. Black dust sprinkled on the polar caps will capture warmth. Massive tunnels, kilometers deep, will be drilled into the mantle to create stupendous vents of hot gases. Against this backdrop of epic upheaval, rivalries, loves and friendships will form and fall to pieces—for there are those who will fight to the death to prevent Mars from ever being changed.

They inevitably caused a sensation when they passed through a small town, and were once taken for an entire orphanage on an outing. Stops were, of course, frequent and once when one of the twelve got left behind, the loss was not discovered for several hours.Democracy was religiously practiced in the Gilbreth family through the medium of the family council.

Goodbye to All That,Robert Graves,3.93,"14,628 rating","January 1, 1929","An autobiographical work that describes firsthand the great tectonic shifts in English society following the First World War, Robert Graves's Goodbye to All That is a matchless evocation of the Great War's haunting legacy, published in Penguin Modern Classics.In 1929 Robert Graves went to live abroad permanently, vowing 'never to make England my home again'. This is his superb account of his life up until that 'bitter leave-taking': from his childhood and desperately unhappy school days at Charterhouse, to his time serving as a young officer in the First World War that was to haunt him throughout his life. It also contains memorable encounters with fellow writers and poets, including Siegfried Sassoon and Thomas Hardy, and looks at his increasingly unhappy marriage to Nancy Nicholson.

He is best known for the historical novel I, Claudius and the critical study of myth and poetry The White Goddess.

From Hell,Alan Moore,4.19,"41,007 rating","January 1, 1999","""I shall tell you where we are. We're in the most extreme and utter region of the human mind. A dim, subconscious underworld. A radiant abyss where men meet themselves. Hell, Netley. We're in Hell."" Having proved himself peerless in the arena of reinterpreting superheroes, Alan Moore turned his ever-incisive eye to the squalid, enigmatic world of Jack the Ripper and the Whitechapel murders of 1888. Weighing in at 576 pages, From Hell is certainly the most epic of Moore's works and remarkably and is possibly his finest effort yet in a career punctuated by such glorious highlights as Watchmen and V for Vendetta. Going beyond the myriad existing theories, which range from the sublime to the ridiculous, Moore presents an ingenious take on the slaughter. His Ripper's brutal activities are the epicentre of a conspiracy involving the very heart of the British Establishment, including the Freemasons and The Royal Family. A popular claim, which is transformed through Moore's exquisite and thoroughly gripping vision, of the Ripper crimes being the womb from which the 20th century, so enmeshed in the celebrity culture of violence, received its shocking, visceral birth. Bolstered by meticulous research that encompasses a wide spectrum of Ripper studies and myths and coupled with his ability to evoke sympathies in such monstrous characters, Moore has created perhaps the finest examination of the Ripper legacy, observing far beyond society's obsessive need to expose Evil's visage. Ultimately, as Moore observes, Jack's identity and his actions are inconsequential to the manner in which society embraced the Fear: ""It's about us. It's about our minds and how they dance. Jack mirrors our hysterias. Faceless, he is the receptacle for each new social panic."" Eddie Campbell's stunning black and white artwork, replete with a scratchy, dirty sheen, is perfectly matched to the often-unshakeable intensity of Moore's writing. Between them, each murder is rendered in horrifying detail, providing the book's most unnerving scenes, made more so in uncomfortable, yet lyrical moments as when the villain embraces an eviscerated corpse, craving understanding; pleading that they ""are wed in legend, inextricable within eternity"". Though technically a comic, the term hardly begins to describe From Hell's inimitable grandeur and finesse, as it takes the medium to fresh heights of ingenuity and craftsmanship. Moore and Campbell's autopsy on the emaciated corpse of the Ripper myth has divulged a deeply disturbing yet undeniably captivating masterpiece. —Danny Graydon",576,"1,476",19.8k follower,"['Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Crime', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Crime', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Crime', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Crime', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Crime', 'Graphic Novels Comics']","2,454 review","19,175 (46%)","13,385 (32%)","6,089 (14%)","1,716 (4%)",642 (1%)
