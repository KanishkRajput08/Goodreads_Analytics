Following an Australian government edict in 1931, black aboriginal children and children of mixed marriages were gathered up by whites and taken to settlements to be assimilated. In Rabbit-Proof Fence, award-winning author Doris Pilkington traces the captivating story of her mother, Molly, one of three young girls uprooted from her community in Southwestern Australia and taken to the Moore River Native Settlement. At the settlement, Milly and her relatives Gracie and Daisy were forbidden to speak their native language, forced to abandon their aboriginal heritage, and taught to be culturally white. After regular stays in solitary confinement, the three girls scared and homesick planned and executed a daring escape from the grim camp, with its harsh life of padlocks, barred windows, and hard cold beds.The girls headed for the nearby rabbit-proof fence that stretched over 1,000 miles through the desert toward their home. Their journey lasted over a month, and they survived on everything from emus to feral cats, while narrowly avoiding the police, professional trackers, and hostile white settlers. Their story is a truly moving tale of defiance and resilience.About the author: Doris Pilkington is also the author of Caprice: A Stockman's Daughter.

That Awful Mess on the Via Merulana,Carlo Emilio Gadda,3.62,"3,139 rating","June 1, 1957","In a large apartment house in the center of Rome, two crimes are committed within a matter of days: a burglary, in which a good deal of money and precious jewels are taken, and a murder, as a young woman whose husband is out of town is found with her throat cut. Called in to investigate, melancholy Detective Ciccio, a secret admirer of the murdered woman and a friend of her husband’s, discovers that almost everyone in the apartment building is somehow involved in the case, and with each new development the mystery only deepens and broadens. Gadda’s sublimely different detective story presents a scathing picture of fascist Italy while tracking the elusiveness of the truth, the impossibility of proof, and the infinite complexity of the workings of fate, showing how they come into conflict with the demands of justice and love.

Father and Son,Edmund Gosse,3.75,"1,022 rating","January 1, 1907","Edmund Gosse wrote of his account of his life, ""This book is the record of a struggle between two temperaments, two consciences and almost two epochs."" Father and Son remains one of English literature's seminal autobiographies. In it, Edmund Gosse recounts, with humor and pathos, his childhoodas a member of a Victorian Protestant sect and his struggles to forge his own identity despite the loving control of his father. His work is a key document of the crisis of faith and doubt and a penetrating exploration of the impact of evolutionary science. An astute, well-observed, and movingportrait of the tensions of family life, Father and Son remains a classic of twentieth-century literature.This edition contains an illuminating introduction, and provides a series of fascinating appendices including extracts from Philip Gosse's Omphalos and Edmund Gosse's harrowing account of his wife's death from breast cancer.",304,663,15 follower,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Classics', 'Religion', 'Autobiography', 'Literature', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Classics', 'Religion', 'Autobiography', 'Literature', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Classics', 'Religion', 'Autobiography', 'Literature']",130 review,263 (25%),370 (36%),283 (27%),84 (8%),22 (2%)

The Strange Career of Jim Crow,C. Vann Woodward,4.14,"3,070 rating","February 1, 1955","C. Vann Woodward, who died in 1999 at the age of 91, was America's most eminent Southern historian, the winner of a Pulitzer Prize for Mary Chestnut's Civil War and a Bancroft Prize for The Origins of the New South. Now, to honor his long and truly distinguished career, Oxford is pleased to publish this special commemorative edition of Woodward's most influential work, The Strange Career of Jim Crow.The Strange Career of Jim Crow is one of the great works of Southern history. Indeed, the book actually helped shape that history. Published in 1955, a year after the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education ordered schools desegregated, Strange Career was cited so often to counter arguments for segregation that Martin Luther King, Jr. called it ""the historical Bible of the civil rights movement."" The book offers a clear and illuminating analysis of the history of Jim Crow laws, presenting evidence that segregation in the South dated only to the 1890s. Woodward convincingly shows that, even under slavery, the two races had not been divided as they were under the Jim Crow laws of the 1890s. In fact, during Reconstruction, there was considerable economic and political mixing of the races. The segregating of the races was a relative newcomer to the region.Hailed as one of the top 100 nonfiction works of the twentieth century, The Strange Career of Jim Crow has sold almost a million copies and remains, in the words of David Herbert Donald, ""a landmark in the history of American race relations.""",245,64,51 follower,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Race', 'American History', 'Politics', 'African American', 'Social Justice', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Race', 'American History', 'Politics', 'African American', 'Social Justice', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Race', 'American History', 'Politics', 'African American', 'Social Justice']",189 review,"1,341 (43%)","1,048 (34%)",508 (16%),107 (3%),66 (2%)

From there on it follows Ice People through the centuries, with members of the clan migrating from Norway to Denmark and Sweden. Other members of the clan wind up in or visit various corners of Europe and Asia over the course of the series.Ice People are cursed with a terrible forefather, Tengel the Evil, whose actions resulted in at least one cursed individual being born in every generation. The cursed individuals were born with magical and mystical abilities, but also the potential for bottomless evil. They have also yellow eyes, malformed shoulder blades and Mongol features. Some cursed individuals fought their tendency to evil, whilst others embraced it.Each book tells a separate story, very often the story of one or a few individuals of the clan. Quite often the protagonist of each book is a female, sometimes of Ice People, but sometimes one who will marry into the clan. Many of the books also focus on the cursed individuals, their battle with their evil tendencies, and also how they utilise their powers, be it for good or evil.","First published January 1, 1989",209,353 follower,"['Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Supernatural', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Paranormal', 'Urban Fantasy']",36 review,328 (52%),199 (32%),81 (13%),11 (1%),2 (<1%)

Burrough's favorite book, one he admitted lifting big chunks of from memory for his first novel, Junky.

Banker To The Poor: The Autobiography Of Muhammad Yunus Of The Grameen Bank   First Edition,Muhammad Yunus,4.12,"10,070 rating","January 1, 1991","Muhammad Yunus is that rare a bona fide visionary. His dream is the total eradication of poverty from the world. In 1983, against the advice of banking and government officials, Yunus established Grameen, a bank devoted to providing the poorest of Bangladesh with minuscule loans. Grameen Bank, based on the belief that credit is a basic human right, not the privilege of a fortunate few, now provides over 2.5 billion dollars of micro-loans to more than two million families in rural Bangladesh. Ninety-four percent of Yunus's clients are women, and repayment rates are near 100 percent. Around the world, micro-lending programs inspired by Grameen are blossoming, with more than three hundred programs established in the United States alone.Banker to the Poor is Muhammad Yunus's memoir of how he decided to change his life in order to help the world's poor. In it he traces the intellectual and spiritual journey that led him to fundamentally rethink the economic relationship between rich and poor, and the challenges he and his colleagues faced in founding Grameen. He also provides wise, hopeful guidance for anyone who would like to join him in ""putting homelessness and destitution in a museum so that one day our children will visit it and ask how we could have allowed such a terrible thing to go on for so long."" The definitive history of micro-credit direct from the man that conceived of it, Banker to the Poor is necessary and inspirational reading for anyone interested in economics, public policy, philanthropy, social history, and business.Muhammad Yunus was born in Bangladesh and earned his Ph.D. in economics in the United States at Vanderbilt University, where he was deeply influenced by the civil rights movement. He still lives in Bangladesh, and travels widely around the world on behalf of Grameen Bank and the concept of micro-credit.","HardcoverFirst published January 1, 1991",65,451 follower,"['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Finance', 'Poverty', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Finance', 'Poverty', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Finance', 'Poverty', 'Biography', 'Politics']","1,013 review","3,765 (37%)","4,147 (41%)","1,784 (17%)",305 (3%),69 (<1%)

Beyond Freedom and Dignity,B.F. Skinner,3.76,"2,261 rating","January 1, 1971","In this profound and profoundly controversial work, a landmark of 20th-century thought originally published in 1971, B. F. Skinner makes his definitive statement about humankind and society. Insisting that the problems of the world today can be solved only by dealing much more effectively with human behavior, Skinner argues that our traditional concepts of freedom and dignity must be sharply revised. They have played an important historical role in our struggle against many kinds of tyranny, he acknowledges, but they are now responsible for the futile defense of a presumed free and autonomous individual; they are perpetuating our use of punishment and blocking the development of more effective cultural practices. Basing his arguments on the massive results of the experimental analysis of behavior he pioneered, Skinner rejects traditional explanations of behavior in terms of states of mind, feelings, and other mental attributes in favor of explanations to be sought in the interaction between genetic endowment and personal history. He argues that instead of promoting freedom and dignity as personal attributes, we should direct our attention to the physical and social environments in which people live. It is the environment rather than humankind itself that must be changed if the traditional goals of the struggle for freedom and dignity are to be reached. Beyond Freedom and Dignity urges us to reexamine the ideals we have taken for granted and to consider the possibility of a radically behaviorist approach to human problems--one that has appeared to some incompatible with those ideals, but which envisions the building of a world in which humankind can attain its greatest possible achievements.",240,55,434 follower,"['Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'Classics']",133 review,710 (31%),686 (30%),567 (25%),211 (9%),87 (3%)
