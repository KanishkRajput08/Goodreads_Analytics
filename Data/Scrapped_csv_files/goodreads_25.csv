But for the Royal Air Force pilot who has just taken off from West Germany, this single-seat jet is the only way to make it back to England for Christmas morning. His flight plan is simple; the fuel tank is full. In sixty-six minutes, he will be back in Blighty. But then the plane begins to fail. First the compass goes haywire, then the radio dies. Lost and alone above the English coast, the pilot is searching for a landing strip when the fog closes in, signaling certain death. He has given up hope when a second shadow appears—a Mosquito fighter-bomber of World War II vintage. The plane is a “shepherd,” guiding the Vampire to a safe landing, and its appearance is a gift from fate, a miracle out of time—but for one lonely pilot, the mystery has just begun.",128,255,"3,583 follower","['Fiction', 'Christmas', 'Thriller', 'Historical Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Adventure', 'Aviation']",382 review,"1,841 (36%)","1,737 (34%)","1,069 (21%)",269 (5%),113 (2%)

The Sandman: The Dream Hunters,Neil Gaiman,4.41,"20,737 rating","January 1, 1999","Sandman fans should feel lucky that master fantasy writer Neil Gaiman discovered the mythical world of Japanese fables while researching his translation of Hayao Miyazaki's film Princess Mononoke. At the same time, while preparing for the Sandman 10th anniversary, he met Yoshitaka Amano, his artist for the 11th Sandman book. Amano is the famed designer of the Final Fantasy game series. The product of Gaiman's immersion in Japanese art, culture, and history, Sandman: Dream Hunters is a classic Japanese tale (adapted from ""The Fox, the Monk, and the Mikado of All Night's Dreaming"") that he has subtly morphed into his Sandman universe.Like most fables, the story begins with a wager between two jealous animals, a fox and a badger: which of them can drive a young monk from his solitary temple? The winner will make the temple into a new fox or badger home. But as the fox adopts the form of a woman to woo the monk from his hermitage, she falls in love with him. Meanwhile, in far away Kyoto, the wealthy Master of Yin-Yang, the onmyoji, is plagued by his fears and seeks tranquility in his command of sorcery. He learns of the monk and his inner peace; he dispatches demons to plague the monk in his dreams and eventually kill him to bring his peace to the onmyoji. The fox overhears the demons on their way to the monk and begins her struggle to save the man whom at first she so envied.Dream Hunters is a beautiful package. From the ink-brush painted endpapers to the luminous page layouts--including Amano's gate-fold painting of Morpheus in a sea of reds, oranges, and violets--this book has been crafted for a sensuous reading experience. Gaiman has developed as a prose stylist in the last several years with novels and stories such as Neverwhere and Stardust, and his narrative rings with a sense of timelessness and magic that gently sustains this adult fairy tale. The only disappointment here is that the book is so brief. One could imagine this creative team being even better suited to a longer story of more epic proportions. On the final page of Dream Hunters, in fact, Amano suggest that he will collaborate further with Mr. Gaiman in the future. Readers of Dream Hunters will hope that Amano's dream comes true. --Patrick O'Kelley",128,"2,138",314k follower,"['Graphic Novels', 'Fantasy', 'Comics', 'Fiction', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Mythology', 'Horror', 'Graphic Novels', 'Fantasy', 'Comics', 'Fiction', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Mythology', 'Horror', 'Graphic Novels', 'Fantasy', 'Comics', 'Fiction', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Mythology', 'Horror']",823 review,"11,502 (55%)","6,615 (31%)","2,280 (10%)",281 (1%),59 (<1%)
La colmena,Camilo José Cela,3.75,"9,024 rating","January 1, 1951","La estructura externa está compuesta de seis capítulos y un epílogo. Cada capítulo consta de un número variable de secuencias de corta extensión, que desarrollan episodios que están mezclados con otros que ocurren simultáneamente. De esta manera el argumento se rompe en multitud de pequeñas anécdotas. Lo importante es la suma de las mismas, que conforma un conjunto de vidas cruzadas, como las celdas de una colmena.El marco espacio-temporal es muy preciso: Madrid en unos días del año 1943, en plena posguerra. La historia se basa en un espacio novelesco reducido pero con bastantes personajes que intervienen poco en el transcurso de la obra y dan una visión social coral. De entre los trescientos personajes que aparecen, escasean tanto los de las clases más acomodadas como los de la clase obrera y sectores marginados, predominando la clase media baja, la pequeña burguesía venida a menos, cuyas ilusiones y proyectos de futuro son engañosos y cuyas miradas «jamás descubren horizontes nuevos», en una vida relatada como una «mañana eternamente repetida». La novela aparece como primera parte de una serie que había de llevar el título de «Caminos inciertos».La voluntad de reflejar con exactitud la realidad no supone la absoluta neutralidad del autor, que interviene de dos formas contradictorias.

Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America,David Hackett Fischer,4.36,"3,203 rating","January 1, 1989","This book is the first volume in a cultural history of the United States, from the earliest English settlements to our own time. It is a history of American folkways as they have changed through time, and it argues a thesis about the importance for the United States of having been British in its cultural origins.From 1629 to 1775, North America was settled by four great waves of English-speaking immigrants. The first was an exodus of Puritans from the east of England to Massachusetts (1629-1640). The second was the movement of a Royalist elite and indentured servants from the south of England to Virginia (ca. 1649-75). The third was the ""Friends' migration,""--the Quakers--from the North Midlands and Wales to the Delaware Valley (ca. 1675-1725). The fourth was a great flight from the borderlands of North Britain and northern Ireland to the American backcountry (ca. 1717-75).These four groups differed in many ways--in religion, rank, generation and place of origin. They brought to America different folkways which became the basis of regional cultures in the United States. They spoke distinctive English dialects and built their houses in diverse ways. They had different ideas of family, marriage and gender; different practices of child-naming and child-raising; different attitudes toward sex, age and death; different rituals of worship and magic; different forms of work and play; different customs of food and dress; different traditions of education and literacy; different modes of settlement and association. They also had profoundly different ideas of comity, order, power and freedom which derived from British folk-traditions. Albion's Seed describes those differences in detail, and discusses the continuing importance of their transference to America.Today most people in the United States (more than 80 percent) have no British ancestors at all. These many other groups, even while preserving their own ethnic cultures, have also assimilated regional folkways which were transplanted from Britain to America. In that sense, nearly all Americans today are ""Albion's Seed,"" no matter what their ethnic origins may be; but they are so in their different regional ways. The concluding section of Albion's Seed explores the ways that regional cultures have continued to dominate national politics from 1789 to 1988, and still control attitudes toward education, government, gender, and violence, on which differences between American regions are greater than between European nations.Albion's Seed also argues that the four British folkways created an expansive cultural pluralism that has proved to the more libertarian than any single culture alone could be. Together they became the determinants of a voluntary society in the United States.",946,31,420 follower,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Politics', 'American', 'Sociology', 'Cultural']",395 review,"1,720 (53%)","1,029 (32%)",356 (11%),74 (2%),24 (<1%)
Jailbird,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,3.83,"24,402 rating","January 1, 1979","“[Kurt Vonnegut] has never been more satirically on-target. . . .

Rejecting the conventional monolithic concept of a 'society', Dr. Mann's model is instead one of a series of overlapping, intersecting power networks.

Their fanatically held opinions—leading to a duel that is proposed but never fought—inspire a host of comic adventures whose allegorical levels vigorously explore the debate between theism and atheism.Martin Gardner's superb introduction to The Ball and the Cross reveals the real-life debate between Chesterton and a famous atheist that provided inspiration for the story, and it explores some of the novel's possible allegorical meanings.

The War Prayer,Mark Twain,4.41,"2,069 rating","January 1, 1905","Written by Mark Twain during the Philippine-American War in the first decade of the twentieth century, The War Prayer tells of a patriotic church service held to send the town's young men off to war. During the service, a stranger enters and addresses the gathering. He tells the patriotic crowd that their prayers for victory are double-edged-by praying for victory they are also praying for the destruction of the enemy... for the destruction of human life. Originally rejected for publication in 1905 as ""not quite suited to a woman's magazine,"" this antiwar parable remained unpublished until 1923, when Twain's literary executor collected it in the volume Europe and Elsewhere.

Miracle of the Rose,Jean Genet,4.11,"1,303 rating","January 1, 1946","This is the third of Genet's prose works to be published in the United States, following Our Lady of the Flowers (1963) and The Thief's Journal (1964). It is, however, Genet's second novel, having been written in La Santé and Tourelles prisons in 1943, directly after Our Lady of the Flowers. Like that first work, Miracle of the Rose was written in the solitude of a prison cell, on the pieces of white paper the penal authorities furnish the convicts for making paper bags.The work is set in the State prison of Fontevrault. It is the height of the German Occupation and in the prisons of France the convicts, barely subsisting on near-starvation rations, spend their endless days weaving camouflage nets for their German conquerors. Miracle of the Rose is, first of all, an account of life at Fontevrault during that period. But Genet is no realist, and his account of prison life is an extraordinary mixture of dreams and reality, past and present.If Fontevrault is the present of his narrative, the past is the Mettray Reformatory, the almost idyllic, flower-covered ""prison colony"" for boys to which he was sent for theft as a mere child. It was here at Mettray that he was initiated into the life of confinement, into the world of the criminals and homosexuals in which he was to live for the next twenty-five years. Genet's story moves back and forth between Fontevrault and Mettray almost without the reader's being aware of the transition. Doubtless, in Genet's mind, there is no transition. Both prisons and both times fuse into one immense and erotic dream.The boys at Mettray do not pity or despise the hardened criminals at neighboring Fontevrault; on the contrary, they are the ""saints"" the boys look up to, the heroes they hope to emulate. More than fifteen years after his precocious arrival at the Mettray Reformatory, Genet finally reaches the Fontevrault Prison. Among the pimps and big shots, the crashers and chickens that form the homosexual hierarchy of the convict criminal society, he finds again many of his former boyhood friends and lovers.Foremost among them is Harcamone, a character notable in the narrative for his off-stage presence. Harcamone has been condemned to death for having killed the only guard at Fontevrault who had ever shown him the least bit of kindness. During the month and a half prior to his execution, his presence from his solitary cell on death row both encompasses and dominates the prison. At one point, as Harcamone passes Genet in the prison corridor, the author has a vision in which he sees the chains that bind Harcamone miraculously flower into a garland of white roses.Miracle of the Rose contains many such visions wherein Genet, taking the dross of ""evil'' transmutes it into a work of beauty.",291,159,"1,085 follower","['Fiction', 'France', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'French Literature', 'Gay', 'Classics']",74 review,545 (41%),450 (34%),234 (17%),48 (3%),26 (1%)

Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism,Michael Parenti,4.43,"5,535 rating","June 1, 1997","
Blackshirts & Reds
 explores some of the big issues of our time: fascism, capitalism, communism, revolution, democracy, and ecology—terms often bandied about but seldom explored in the original and exciting way that has become Michael Parenti’s trademark.Parenti shows how “rational fascism” renders service to capitalism, how corporate power undermines democracy, and how revolutions are a mass empowerment against the forces of exploitative privilege. He also maps out the external and internal forces that destroyed communism, and the disastrous impact of the “free-market” victory on eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He affirms the relevance of taboo ideologies like Marxism, demonstrating the importance of class analysis in understanding political realities and dealing with the ongoing collision between ecology and global corporatism.Written with lucid and compelling style, this book goes beyond truncated modes of thought, inviting us to entertain iconoclastic views, and to ask why things are as they are. It is a bold and entertaining exploration of the epic struggles of yesterday and today.""A penetrating and persuasive writer with an astonishing array of documentation to implement his attacks.""—The Catholic Journalist""Blackshirts & Reds discusses the great combat between fascism and socialism that is the defining feature of the Twentieth Century, and takes every official version to task for its substitution of moral analysis for critical analysis, for its selectivity, and for its errata. By portraying the struggle between fascism and Communism in this century as a single conflict, and not a series of discrete encounters, between the insatiable need for new capital on the one hand and the survival of a system under siege on the other, Parenti defines fascism as the weapon of capitalism, not simply an extreme form of it. Fascism is not an aberration, he points out, but a ""rational"" and integral component of the system.""—Stan Goff, The PrismMichael Parenti, PhD Yale, is an internationally known author and lecturer. He is one of the nation's leading progressive political analysts. He is the author of over 275 published articles and twenty books.
