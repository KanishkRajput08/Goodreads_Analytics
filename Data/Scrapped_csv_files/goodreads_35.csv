The Selected Works,Cesare Pavese,4.05,140 rating,"January 1, 1968","""There is only one pleasure, that of being alive. All the rest is misery,"" wrote Cesare Pavese, whose short, intense life spanned the ordeals of fascism and World War II to witness the beginnings of Italy's postwar prosperity. Searchingly alert to nuances of speech, feeling, and atmosphere, and remarkably varied, his novels offer a panoramic vision, at once sensual and finely considered, of a time of tumultuous change. This volume presents readers with Pavese's major works. The Beach is a wry summertime comedy of sexual and romantic misunderstandings, while The House on the Hill is an extraordinary novel of war in which a teacher flees through a countryside that is both beautiful and convulsed with terror. Among Women Only tells of a fashion designer who enters the affluent world she has always dreamed of, only to find herself caught up in an eerie dance of destruction, and The Devil in the Hills is an engaging road novel about three young men roaming the hills in high summer who stumble on mysteries of love and death.",592,"['Fiction', 'Italian Literature', 'Short Stories', 'Italy', 'Classics', '20th Century', 'Literature', 'Fiction', 'Italian Literature', 'Short Stories', 'Italy', 'Classics', '20th Century', 'Literature', 'Fiction', 'Italian Literature', 'Short Stories', 'Italy', 'Classics', '20th Century', 'Literature']","1,055 follower",16 review,300,0 (0%),7 (5%),29 (20%),54 (38%),50 (35%)
The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette,Carolly Erickson,3.64,"6,983 rating","January 1, 1997","Imagine that, on the night before she is to die under the blade of the guillotine, Marie Antoinette leaves behind in her prison cell a diary telling the story of her life―from her privileged childhood as Austrian Archduchess to her years as glamorous mistress of Versailles to the heartbreak of imprisonment and humiliation during the French Revolution. Carolly Erickson takes the reader deep into the psyche of France's doomed queen: her love affair with handsome Swedish diplomat Count Axel Fersen, who risked his life to save her; her fears on the terrifying night the Parisian mob broke into her palace bedroom intent on murdering her and her family; her harrowing attempted flight from France in disguise; her recapture and the grim months of harsh captivity; her agony when her beloved husband was guillotined and her young son was torn from her arms, never to be seen again. Erickson brilliantly captures the queen's voice, her hopes, her dreads, and her suffering. We follow, mesmerized, as she reveals every detail of her remarkable, eventful life―from her teenage years when she began keeping a diary to her final days when she awaited her own bloody appointment with the guillotine.",343,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'France', 'Romance', '18th Century', 'French Revolution']",682 follower,627 review,43,178 (2%),636 (9%),"2,247 (32%)","2,397 (34%)","1,525 (21%)"

What's So Amazing About Grace?,Philip Yancey,4.18,"42,499 rating","January 1, 1997","Original Cover Edition for ISBN 0310245656In 1987, an IRA bomb buried Gordon Wilson and his twenty-year-old daughter beneath five feet of rubble. Gordon alone survived. And forgave. He said of the bombers, ' I have lost my daughter, but I bear no grudge . . . I shall pray, tonight and every night, that God will forgive them.' His words caught the media's ears  and out of one man's grief, the world got a glimpse of grace. Grace is the church's great distinctive. It's the one thing the world cannot duplicate, and the one thing it craves above all else  for only grace can bring hope and transformation to a jaded world. In What's So Amazing About Grace? award-winning author Philip Yancey explores grace at street level. If grace is God's love for the undeserving, he asks, then what does it look like in action? And if Christians are its sole dispensers, then how are we doing at lavishing grace on a world that knows far more of cruelty and unforgiveness than it does of mercy? Yancey sets grace in the midst of life's stark images, tests its mettle against horrific 'ungrace.' Can grace survive in the midst of such atrocities as the Nazi holocaust? Can it triumph over the brutality of the Ku Klux Klan? Should any grace at all be shown to the likes of Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed and cannibalized seventeen young men? Grace does not excuse sin, says Yancey, but it treasures the sinner. True grace is shocking, scandalous. It shakes our conventions with its insistence on getting close to sinners and touching them with mercy and hope. It forgives the unfaithful spouse, the racist, the child abuser. It loves today's AIDS-ridden addict as much as the tax collector of Jesus' day. In his most personal and provocative book ever, Yancey offers compelling, true portraits of grace's life-changing power. He searches for its presence in his own life and in the church. He asks, How can Christians contend graciously with moral issues that threaten all they hold dear? And he challenges us to become living answers to a world that desperately wants to know, What's So Amazing About Grace?",300,"['Christian', 'Nonfiction', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Faith', 'Theology', 'Christian Living']","2,225 follower","1,221 review",258,"1,231 (2%)","1,634 (3%)","5,879 (13%)","13,108 (30%)","20,647 (48%)"

Zilele şi nopţile unui student întârziat,Gib I. Mihăescu,3.70,254 rating,"January 1, 1934","Deşi critica veche nu l-a apreciat. Zilele şi nopţile unui student întârziat rămâne cel mai bun roman al lui Gib I. Mihăescu. Şi aici intervine tema bova­rismului masculin. [...] Romanul are la început o originală fac­tură picarescă şi reconstituie cu umor şi cu multă culoare at­mosfera mahalalelor bătute de erou. O tipologie bogată, schi­ţată cu mână sigură, populează cartea, dând o imagine plină de veridicitate a mediului ambiant. Interesantă şi surprinzătoare e răsturnarea care se petrece la un moment dat. Romanul de­vine grav. Psihologia lui Mihnea se adânceşte, problemele exis­tenţei lui câştigă ecouri morale. Bovarismul intelectual e văzut aici sub un unghi critic mult mai ascuţit. Ideea lu Gib I. Mi­hăescu este de a denunţa atât viaţa morală a eroului (acesta e pedepsit prin efectul social nociv al comportării lui, deoarece constată cum pot apărea din alt unghi comportările cinice), cât şi dezarmarea fiinţelor care, ca Arina, trăiesc doar în lumea ficţiunilor ideale, nu ştiu să se apere de animalele prădalnice ale junglei morale din jur. Mihnea Băiatu, în finalul romanului, e decis să cucerească cetatea ştiinţei ca un om întreg, în­văţat cu legile aspre ale exigenţei. Cartea are o rezonanţă sufletească tonică. Idealul urmărit nu mai ia aspectul unei fan­tome înşelătoare, ci e scos dintr-o experienţă dureroasă de viaţă, examinată cu luciditate.OV. S.

Told from the Japanese perspective, The Rising Sun is, in the author’s words, “a factual saga of people caught up in the flood of the most overwhelming war of mankind, told as it happened—muddled, ennobling, disgraceful, frustrating, full of paradox.”In weaving together the historical facts and human drama leading up to and culminating in the war in the Pacific, Toland crafts a riveting and unbiased narrative history. In his Foreword, Toland says that if we are to draw any conclusion from The Rising Sun , it is “that there are no simple lessons in history, that it is human nature that repeats itself, not history.”“Unbelievably rich . . . readable and exciting . . .The best parts of [Toland’s] book are not the battle scenes but the intimate view he gives of the highest reaches of Tokyo politics.”— Newsweek",976,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Japan', 'World War II', 'War', 'Military History', 'Asia']",162 follower,335 review,72,47 (<1%),144 (2%),674 (12%),"1,898 (35%)","2,609 (48%)"

Revolt Against the Modern World,Julius Evola,4.02,"1,783 rating","January 1, 1934","In what many consider to be his masterwork, Evola contrasts the characteristics of the modern world with those of traditional societies, from politics and institutions to views on life and death. ""No idea is as absurd as the idea of progress, which together with its corollary notion of the superiority of modern civilization, has created its own 'positive' alibis by falsifying history, by insinuating harmful myths in people's minds, and by proclaiming itself sovereign at the crossroads of the plebeian ideology from which it originated. In order to understand both the spirit of Tradition and its antithesis, modern civilization, it is necessary to begin with the fundamental doctrine of the two natures. According to this doctrine there is a physical order of things and a metaphysical one; there is a mortal nature and an immortal one; there is the superior realm of 'being' and the inferior realm of 'becoming.' Generally speaking, there is a visible and tangible dimension and, prior to and beyond it, an invisible and intangible dimension that is the support, the source, and the true life of the former."" —From Chapter One. With unflinching gaze and uncompromising intensity Julius Evola analyzes the spiritual and cultural malaise at the heart of Western civilization and all that passes for progress in the modern world. As a gadfly, Evola spares no one and nothing in his survey of what we have lost and where we are headed. At turns prophetic and provocative, Revolt against the Modern World outlines a profound metaphysics of history and demonstrates how and why we have lost contact with the transcendent dimension of being. The revolt advocated by Evola does not resemble the familiar protests of either liberals or conservatives. His criticisms are not limited to exposing the mindless nature of consumerism, the march of progress, the rise of technocracy, or the dominance of unalloyed individualism, although these and other subjects come under his scrutiny. Rather, he attempts to trace in space and time the remote causes and processes that have exercised corrosive influence on what he considers to be the higher values, ideals, beliefs, and codes of conduct—the world of Tradition—that are at the foundation of Western civilization and described in the myths and sacred literature of the Indo-Europeans. Agreeing with the Hindu philosophers that history is the movement of huge cycles and that we are now in the Kali Yuga, the age of dissolution and decadence, Evola finds revolt to be the only logical response for those who oppose the materialism and ritualized meaninglessness of life in the twentieth century. Through a sweeping study of the structures, myths, beliefs, and spiritual traditions of the major Western civilizations, the author compares the characteristics of the modern world with those of traditional societies. The domains explored include politics, law, the rise and fall of empires, the history of the Church, the doctrine of the two natures, life and death, social institutions and the caste system, the limits of racial theories, capitalism and communism, relations between the sexes, and the meaning of warriorhood. At every turn Evola challenges the reader's most cherished assumptions about fundamental aspects of modern life.",375,"['Philosophy', 'Politics', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Sociology', 'Spirituality']",763 follower,145 review,192,111 (6%),104 (5%),255 (14%),490 (27%),823 (46%)

In so doing, he explored questions regarding the purpose of education and whether the democratization of education altered that purpose and reshaped its form.In considering the historic tension between access to education and excellence in education, Hofstadter argued that both anti-intellectualism and utilitarianism were consequences, in part, of the democratization of knowledge.Moreover, he saw these themes as historically embedded in America's national fabric, an outcome of her colonial European and evangelical Protestant heritage.

A Drink Before the War , the first in Lehane's acclaimed series with Boston detectives Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, is a remarkable debut that is at once a pulsating crime thriller and a mirror of our world, one in which the worst human horrors are found closest to home, and the most vicious obscenities are committed in the name of love.",282,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Detective', 'Noir']",12.7k follower,"2,397 review",101,567 (1%),"1,732 (4%)","9,480 (22%)","18,553 (43%)","12,040 (28%)"

Buch der Erinnerung,Péter Nádas,4.07,570 rating,"January 1, 1986","Das Buch der Erinnerung von Péter Nádas, ein Meilenstein der ungarischen Nachkriegsliteratur, zeichnet ein Bild des 20. Jahrhunderts, indem es die Erschütterungen und Wechsellagen seiner äußeren Geschichte mit einer eindringlichen Beschreibung und Analyse des Gefühlslebens in Verbindung bringt. Es dokumentiert das Lebensgefühl eines Intellektuellen in der Auseinandersetzung mit einem menschenfeindlichen System.Entstehung: Elf Jahre lang arbeitete Nádas an seinem über 1300 Seiten starken Roman. Wie er in einem Vorspann zur deutschen Ausgabe mitteilte, war es sein Anliegen, parallele Erinnerungen verschiedener Personen zu verschiedenen Zeiten so niederzuschreiben, als wären alle diese Personen er, ohne dass er es wirklich wäre.Inhalt: Im Mittelpunkt des Romans steht ein etwa 30-jähriger ungarischer Schriftsteller. Dieser namenlose Ich-Erzähler befindet sich Anfang der 1970er Jahre in Ostberlin. Er durchlebt eine Krise, da sein geliebter Freund Melchior, ein deutscher Schriftsteller, in den Westen geflohen ist. Der Erzähler kehrt daraufhin nach Ungarn zurück und beginnt mit der Aufzeichnung seiner Erinnerungen. Um sich des eigenen Schicksals bewusst zu werden, entwirft er einen Roman um einen Schriftsteller, der sich zu Beginn des Jahrhunderts in Berlin und im Ostseebad Heiligendamm aufhält. Dieser Erzählstrang, aus der Perspektive der Hauptfigur ebenfalls in Ich-Form erzählt, ist die zweite Ebene des Romans. Die dritte führt in das Budapest der 1950er Jahre und schildert die schreckliche Kindheit des ersten Erzählers in einer großbürgerlichen Familie während der Zeit der stalinistischen Diktatur Rákosis.Der aus Ostberlin nach Budapest zurückgekehrte Erzähler stirbt schließlich eines gewaltsamen Todes; er wird von Motorradfahrern vorsätzlich überfahren. Krisztian, ein alter Schulfreund des Erzählers, nimmt das Erinnerungsbuch an sich, betrachtet die dort geschilderte, gemeinsam verbrachte Kindheit aus seiner Perspektive und sinniert über die Existenz und Identität seines toten Freundes.Struktur: Das Buch besitzt einen äußerst komplexen Aufbau, der vom Leser ein hohes Maß an Aufmerksamkeit und Aufnahmebereitschaft fordert. Es führt in ein Labyrinth aus Raum und Zeit, in dem sich die unterschiedlichen Ebenen vielfach verbinden und überlagern. Es tritt eine Fülle von Personen auf, deren Lebenskreise sich berühren und schneiden. Den Kern des Romans bildet die Verknüpfung zweier Biografien: die des ungarischen Schriftstellers, der seine Vergangenheit erforscht, und jene des jungen Deutschen, der ein Produkt der Fantasie der Hauptfigur ist.Der Text ist in drei Haupt-Erzählstränge gegliedert, in denen ein jeweils anderer Ich-Erzähler an verschiedenen Orten zu verschiedenen Zeiten auftritt. Diese parallelen Erinne- rungen sind jedoch nicht einander nachgestellt, sondern ineinander verschachtelt. Auch innerhalb der einzelnen Erzählstränge wird die Handlung immer wieder von akribisch und minutiös geschilderten Episoden, Bildern und Befindlichkeiten unterbrochen. Selbst auf der Ebene der einzelnen Sätze – lange Sätze, die kunstvoll komponiert und verschachtelt sind – wird dieses Prinzip des Unterbrechens und Hinhaltens angewendet. Inhalt und Sprache des Texts entsprechen dem Wesen des Erinnerns, sie folgen dem unberechenbaren Strom der Erinnerungen.Wirkung: Das Buch der Erinnerung begründete Nádas’ internationalen Ruf als Schriftsteller und wurde mit zahlreichen renommierten Literatur-Preisen ausgezeichnet.
