The Death of a President: November 1963,William Manchester,4.25,"4,316 rating","January 1, 1967","On a lovely October evening in 1961 President Kennedy and William Manchester sat in the Oval Room of the White House, talking for three and a half hours. At first the discussion was detached; Mr. Manchester was writing his Portrait of a President. But soon they were conversing as two men do who have lived many of the same years in the same places. Both were natives of Massachusetts. As a World War II Marine on Guadalcanal, Manchester had been separated by only a narrow strait from Kennedy's PT-109 base on Tulagi. They had both been awarded Purple Hearts before leaving the Pacific. Now they were fathers of daughters the same age, had traveled in the same foreign countries, and shared a deep interest in American history.More than two years later, following the assassination of President Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy realized that she and others would be obliged to share their recollections of the national tragedy with a responsible writer--and so she and Senator Robert Kennedy asked Mr. Manchester to set down a history of the assassination and the days immediately preceding and following it.At the invitation of the Chief Justice, Mr. Manchester was a privileged observer of the Warren Commission inquiry. Meanwhile, however, he had developed his own sources of information. Operating out of headquarters in the National Archives, for two years he worked twelve to fifteen hours a day, conducting a major historical investigation throughout Texas and elsewhere, accumulating forty-five volumes and portfolios of transcribed tapes, shorthand, documents and exhibits, all of which will be deposited in the Kennedy Library. Finally, in New England, he completed a 350,000-word manuscript, not for scrutiny by the family but to set down as a whole the national and personal tragedy.The result is a powerful narrative which, in the opinion of the publisher, is both a significant contribution to history and an eminent literary achievement.",711,131,488 follower,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Politics', 'Biography', 'Presidents', 'True Crime']",207 review,"2,112 (48%)","1,409 (32%)",602 (13%),127 (2%),66 (1%)
Iceland's Bell,Halldór Laxness,3.88,"2,160 rating","January 1, 1943","Sometimes grim, sometimes uproarious, and always captivating, Iceland’s Bell by Nobel Laureate Halldór Laxness is at once an updating of the traditional Icelandic saga and a caustic social satire. At the close of the 17th century, Iceland is an oppressed Danish colony, suffering from extreme poverty, famine, and plague. A farmer and accused cord-thief named Jon Hreggvidsson makes an improper joke about the Danish king and soon after finds himself a fugitive charged with the murder of the king’s hangman.In the years that follow, the hapless but resilient rogue Hreggvidsson becomes a pawn entangled in political and personal conflicts playing out on a far grander scale. Chief among these is the star-crossed love affair between Snaefridur, known as “Iceland’s Sun,” a beautiful, headstrong young noblewoman, and Arnas Arnaeus, the king’s antiquarian, an aristocrat whose worldly manner conceals a fierce devotion to his downtrodden countrymen. As their personal struggle plays itself out on an international stage, Iceland’s Bell creates a Dickensian canvas of heroism and venality, violence and tragedy, charged with narrative enchantment on every page.",425,153,684 follower,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Nobel Prize', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Nobel Prize', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Nobel Prize', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature']",193 review,629 (29%),843 (39%),511 (23%),151 (6%),26 (1%)

The Discovery of Freedom: Man's Struggle Against Authority,Rose Wilder Lane,4.14,271 rating,"January 1, 1943","This is a book of timeless importance. It must be read by anyone who is seriously interested in the heritage of liberty--not just in America, but the world over. And reading it is a joy. Lane, who is said to have written the book 'at white heat,' was at once a brilliant thinker and a gifted storyteller.This book is a withering attack on statism, nationalism, and what Nobel Laureate F. A. Hayek calls the 'fatal conceit' of national economic planning. It is an intellectual tour de force that stood up to the collectivist paradigm of its time and pointed the way to rediscovering the principles of the American Revolution--a true revolution unlike those of the Old World that 'are revolutions only in the sense that a wheel's turning is a revolution.' Her exciting description of the revolutionary period (you can tell she wishes she'd been there to lend a hand to Paine, Mason, Jefferson and the gang) is the best of a brilliant book.Rose Wilder Lane was a truly remarkable woman. Like Jefferson, she attacked life, living it to the fullest, as adventurer, journalist, world traveler, iconoclast, and just prior to her death, war corespondent in Vietnam. Not surprisingly, the clear-eyed determination and supercharged energy she brings to attacking the enemies of liberty in Discovery is unique among prominent pro-liberty writers.

Eagle in the Snow,Wallace Breem,4.12,"2,653 rating","January 1, 1970","Banished to the Empire's farthest outpost, veteran warrior Paulinus Maximus defends The Wall of Britannia from the constant onslaught of belligerent barbarian tribes. Bravery, loyalty, experience, and success lead to Maximus' appointment as ""General of the West"" by the Roman emperor, the ambition of a lifetime. But with the title comes a caveat: Maximus needs to muster and command a single legion to defend the perilous Rhine frontier. On the opposite side of the Rhine River, tribal nations are uniting; hundreds of thousands mass in preparation for the conquest of Gaul, and from there, a sweep down into Rome itself. Only a wide river and a wily general keep them in check.  With discipline, deception, persuasion, and surprise, Maximus holds the line against an increasingly desperate and innumerable foe. Friends, allies, and even enemies urge Maximus to proclaim himself emperor. He refuses, bound by an oath of duty, honor, and sacrifice to Rome, a city he has never seen. But then circumstance intervenes. Now, Maximus will accept the purple robe of emperor, if his scrappy legion can deliver this last crucial victory against insurmountable odds. The very fate of Rome hangs in the balance. Combining the brilliantly realized battle action of Gates of Fire and the masterful characterization of Mary Renault's The Last of the Wine, Eagle in the Snow is nothing less than the novel of the fall of the Roman empire.",400,9,39 follower,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Roman', 'War', 'Ancient', 'Military Fiction']",195 review,"1,104 (41%)",963 (36%),431 (16%),112 (4%),43 (1%)

To Dance with Kings,Rosalind Laker,4.10,"3,532 rating","January 1, 1988","An epic generational tale of loves lost, promises kept, dreams broken, and monarchies shattered, To Dance with Kings is a story of passion and privilege, humble beginnings and limitless ambition. On a May morning in 1664, in the small village of Versailles, as hundreds of young aristocrats are coming to pay court to King Louis XIV, a peasant fan-maker gives birth to her first and only child, Marguerite. Determined to give her daughter a better life than the one she herself has lived, the young mother vows to break the newborn’s bonds of poverty and ensure that she fulfills her destiny—to dance with kings. Purely by chance, a drunken nobleman witnesses the birth and makes a reckless promise to return for Marguerite in seventeen years. With those fateful words, events are set into motion that will span three monarchies, affecting the lives of four generations of women. Marguerite becomes part of the royal court of the Sun King, but her fairy-tale existence is torn out from under her by a change of political winds. Jasmin, Marguerite’s daughter, is born to the life of privilege her grandmother dreamed of, but tempts fate by daring to catch the eye of the king. Violette, Marguerite’s granddaughter, is drawn to the nefarious side of life among the nobles at Versailles. And Rose, Violette’s daughter, becomes a lady-in-waiting and confidante to Marie Antoinette. Through Rose, a love lost generations before will come full circle, even as the ground beneath Versailles begins to rumble with the chaos of the coming revolution.",752,90,182 follower,"['Historical Fiction', 'France', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Romance', '17th Century', 'Historical Romance']",225 review,"1,487 (42%)","1,182 (33%)",658 (18%),145 (4%),60 (1%)

"Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.",Ron Chernow,4.17,"30,936 rating","May 5, 1998","John D. Rockefeller, Sr.--history's first billionaire and the patriarch of America's most famous dynasty--is an icon whose true nature has eluded three generations of historians. Now Ron Chernow, the National Book Award-winning biographer of the Morgan and Warburg banking families, gives us a history of the mogul ""etched with uncommon objectivity and literary grace . . . as detailed, balanced, and psychologically insightful a portrait of the tycoon as we may ever have"" (Kirkus Reviews). Titan is the first full-length biography based on unrestricted access to Rockefeller's exceptionally rich trove of papers. A landmark publication full of startling revelations, the book will indelibly alter our image of this most enigmatic capitalist.        Born the son of a flamboyant, bigamous snake-oil salesman and a pious, straitlaced mother, Rockefeller rose from rustic origins to become the world's richest man by creating America's most powerful and feared monopoly, Standard Oil. Branded ""the Octopus"" by legions of muckrakers, the trust refined and marketed nearly 90 percent of the oil produced in America.        Rockefeller was likely the most controversial businessman in our nation's history. Critics charged that his empire was built on unscrupulous tactics: grand-scale collusion with the railroads, predatory pricing, industrial espionage, and wholesale bribery of political officials. The titan spent more than thirty years dodging investigations until Teddy Roosevelt and his trustbusters embarked on a marathon crusade to bring Standard Oil to bay.        While providing abundant new evidence of Rockefeller's misdeeds, Chernow discards the stereotype of the cold-blooded monster to sketch an unforgettably human portrait of a quirky, eccentric original. A devout Baptist and temperance advocate, Rockefeller gave money more generously--his chosen philanthropies included the Rockefeller Foundation, the University of Chicago, and what is today Rockefeller University--than anyone before him. Titan presents a finely nuanced portrait of a fascinating, complex man, synthesizing his public and private lives and disclosing numerous family scandals, tragedies, and misfortunes that have never before come to light.        John D. Rockefeller's story captures a pivotal moment in American history, documenting the dramatic post-Civil War shift from small business to the rise of giant corporations that irrevocably transformed the nation. With cameos by Joseph Pulitzer, William Randolph Hearst, Jay Gould, William Vanderbilt, Ida Tarbell, Andrew Carnegie, Carl Jung, J. Pierpont Morgan, William James, Henry Clay Frick, Mark Twain, and Will Rogers, Titan turns Rockefeller's life into a vivid tapestry of American society in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

The red-headed prostitute Rosina; the junk-dealer Aaron Wassertrum; puppeteers; street musicians; and a deaf-mute silhouette artist.Lurking in its inhabitants’ subconscious is the Golem, a creature of rabbinical myth. Supposedly a manifestation of all the suffering of the ghetto, it comes to life every 33 years in a room without a door. When the jeweller Athanasius Pernath, suffering from broken dreams and amnesia, sees the Golem, he realises to his terror that the ghostly man of clay shares his own face...The Golem, though rarely seen, is central to the novel as a representative of the ghetto's own spirit and consciousness, brought to life by the suffering and misery that its inhabitants have endured over the centuries. Perhaps the most memorable figure in the story is the city of Prague itself, recognisable through its landmarks such as the Street of the Alchemists and the Castle.",264,291,294 follower,"['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Gothic', 'German Literature', 'Literature', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Gothic', 'German Literature', 'Literature', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Gothic', 'German Literature', 'Literature', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Gothic', 'German Literature', 'Literature', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Gothic', 'German Literature', 'Literature']",658 review,"2,331 (29%)","2,900 (36%)","1,886 (23%)",612 (7%),160 (2%)

"The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory",Brian Greene,4.09,"97,413 rating","February 1, 1999","Brian Greene, one of the world's leading string theorists, peels away the layers of mystery surrounding string theory to reveal a universe that consists of eleven dimensions, where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself, and all matter, from the smallest quarks to the most gargantuan supernovas, is generated by the vibrations of microscopically tiny loops of energy.Today, physicists and mathematicians throughout the world are feverishly working on one of the most ambitious theories ever proposed: superstring theory. String theory, as it is often called, is the key to the Unified Field Theory that eluded Einstein for more than thirty years. Finally, the century-old antagonism between the large and the small--General Relativity and Quantum Theory--is resolved. String theory proclaims that all of the wondrous happenings in the universe, from the frantic dancing of subatomic quarks to the majestic swirling of heavenly galaxies, are reflections of one grand physical principle and manifestations of one single entity: microscopically tiny vibrating loops of energy, a billionth of a billionth the size of an atom. In this brilliantly articulated and refreshingly clear book, Greene relates the scientific story and the human struggle behind twentieth-century physics' search for a theory of everything.Through the masterful use of metaphor and analogy, The Elegant Universe makes some of the most sophisticated concepts ever contemplated viscerally accessible and thoroughly entertaining, bringing us closer than ever to understanding how the universe works.",464,45,"3,657 follower","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'Astronomy', 'Popular Science', 'Space', 'Philosophy']","2,279 review","39,219 (40%)","36,052 (37%)","16,149 (16%)","3,750 (3%)","2,243 (2%)"

The book chronicles the maturing of Wolfe's autobiographical character, Eugene Gant, in his desperate search for fulfillment, making his way from small-town North Carolina to the wider world of Harvard University, New York City, and Europe. In a massive, ambitious, and boldly passionate novel, Wolfe examines the passing of time and the nature of the creative process, as Gant slowly but ecstatically embraces the urban life, recognizing it as a necessary ordeal for the birth of his creative genius as a writer.The work of an exceptionally expressive writer of fertile imagination and startling emotional intensity, Of Time and the River illuminates universal truths about art and life, city and country, past and present.

Centuria. Cento piccoli romanzi fiume,Giorgio Manganelli,4.16,776 rating,"January 1, 1979","«Il presente volumetto racchiude in breve spazio una vasta ed amena biblioteca; esso infatti raccoglie cento romanzi fiume, ma così lavorati in modi anamorfici, da apparire al lettore frettoloso testi di poche e scarne righe. Dunque, ambisce ad essere un prodigio della scienza contemporanea alleata alla retorica, recente ritrovamento delle locali Università. Libriccino sterminato, insomma; a leggere il quale il lettore dovrà porre in opera le astuzie che già conosce, e forse altre apprenderne: giochi di luce che consentono di leggere tra le righe, sotto le righe, tra le due facce di un foglio, nei luoghi ove si appartano capitoli elegantemente scabrosi, pagine di nobile efferatezza, e dignitoso esibizionismo, lì depositate per vereconda pietà di infanti e canuti. A ben vedere, il buon lettore vi troverà tutto ciò che gli serve per una vita di letture rilegate: minute descrizioni di case della Georgia dove sorelle destinate a diventare rivali hanno trascorso una adolescenza prima ignara poi torbida; ambagi sessuali, passionali e carnali, minutamente dialogate; memorabili conversioni di anime travagliate; virili addii, femminesca costanza, inflazioni, tumulti plebei, balenanti apparizioni di eroi dal sorriso mite e terribile; persecuzioni, evasioni, e dietro ad una vocale che non nomino, in tralice si potrà scorgere una tavola rotonda sui diritti dell’Uomo. «Se mi si consente un suggerimento, il modo ottimo per leggere questo libercolo, ma costoso, sarebbe: acquistare diritto d’uso d’un grattacielo che abbia il medesimo numero di piani delle righe del testo da leggere; a ciascun piano collocare un lettore con il libro in mano; a ciascun lettore si dia una riga; ad un segnale, il Lettore Supremo comincerà a precipitare dal sommo dell’edificio, e man mano che transiterà di fronte alle finestre, il lettore di ciascun piano leggerà la riga destinatagli, a voce forte e chiara. È necessario che il numero dei piani corrisponda a quello delle righe, e non vi siano equivoci tra ammezzato e primo piano, che potrebbero causare un imbarazzante silenzio prima dello schianto. Bene anche leggerlo nelle tenebre esteriori, meglio se allo zero assoluto, in smarrito abitacolo spaziale» (Giorgio Manganelli).

Litany of the Long Sun,Gene Wolfe,4.24,"2,505 rating","January 1, 1994","Litany of the Long Sun contains the full texts of Nightside the Long Sun and Lake of the Long Sun, that together make up the first half of The Book of the Long Sun. This great work is set on a huge generation starship in the same future as the classic Book of the New Sun.Gene Wolfe's Book of the Long Sun tetralogy ranks as one of the greatest literary achievements of 20th-century science fiction. Litany of the Long Sun, comprising the first two books in the series, is suffused with looming transcendence and theophany. Wolfe takes familiar speculative fiction tropes and embeds them in a tale so complex and wonderful that readers may find themselves wondering whether what they're reading is science fiction, fantasy, or something different altogether. Or whether it matters.The story of Patera Silk, a devout priest whose destiny is wrapped up with the gods he serves, takes place within the Whorl, a vast, cylindrical starship that has traveled for generations and is crumbling into disrepair. Through a strange and amazing series of events, Silk finds himself descending to base thievery, running afoul of a notorious crime lord, befriending a cyborg soldier, and encountering at least one of the gods of Mainframe.But when Silk encounters the Outsider, who may be a God of a very different sort, all his beliefs are shaken to the core, and his life swiftly takes a messianic turn. In a rousing climax, Silk becomes the reluctant leader of a political rebellion against the corrupt Ayuntamiento, who rule the city-state of Viron.It is not necessary to have read Wolfe's Book of the New Sun series, which takes place many centuries earlier, to enjoy the Long Sun novels, but keen-eyed readers will find many clues as to the origin of the Whorl and its gods in those stories. Further, although Wolfe's reputation for literary precision and trickery is well deserved, the Long Sun series (which continues in Epiphany of the Long Sun) is one of the more accessible places to start appreciating the author's treasures.--Therese Littleton",543,496,"3,095 follower","['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Literature']",139 review,"1,169 (46%)",907 (36%),329 (13%),71 (2%),29 (1%)

Yet her resistance is largely passive.Self-absorbed, indecisive, she makes her own uncharted way through life,letting her husband, lovers, even her only daughter, gradually slip away.Signs that she is pregnant after a casual affair rouse her to make decisions. Then a deeply ironic turn of events thrusts her into the cold light of a reluctant self-knowledge. Through layer upon layer of dreams,memories, defenses, and delusions, she emerges finally to take a conscious step toward the independence she cannot yet define, certain only that she herself has changed.In Child of Fortune, Yuko Tsushima has brought to life a woman whose psychological complexity reflects the meeting of Japanese fiction and women's changing consciousness.
