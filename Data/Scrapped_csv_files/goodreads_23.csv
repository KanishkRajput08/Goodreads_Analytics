Economics in One Lesson: The Shortest & Surest Way to Understand Basic Economics,Henry Hazlitt,4.17,"19,619 rating","January 1, 1946","A million copy seller, Henry Hazlitt’s Economics in One Lesson is a classic economic primer. But it is also much more, having become a fundamental influence on modern “libertarian” economics of the type espoused by Ron Paul and others.Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication.  Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.Many current economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson, every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",218,"['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Politics', 'Finance', 'Philosophy', 'History']",374 follower,"1,723 review",100,440 (2%),876 (4%),"2,874 (14%)","6,154 (31%)","9,275 (47%)"

Hearts in Atlantis,Stephen King,3.85,"95,406 rating","September 14, 1999","Five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War.Stephen King, whose first novel, Carrie, was published in 1974, the year before the last U.S. troops withdrew from Vietnam, is the first hugely popular writer of the TV generation. Images from that war -- and the protests against it -- had flooded America's living rooms for a decade. Hearts in Atlantis, King's newest fiction, is composed of five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War. In Part One, ""Low Men in Yellow Coats,"" eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood. He also discovers that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror. In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest...and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast. In ""Blind Willie"" and ""Why We're in Vietnam,"" two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow -- and as haunted -- as their own lives. And in ""Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,"" this remarkable book's denouement, Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, the hope of redemption, and his heart's desire may await him. Full of danger, full of suspense, most of all full of heart, Stephen King's new book will take some readers to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely leave.",640,"['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Short Stories', 'Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Suspense']",841k follower,"2,998 review","2,518","1,547 (1%)","6,501 (6%)","24,841 (26%)","34,107 (35%)","28,410 (29%)"

But when Danny's family falls on hard times, moving from their comfortable home in Brooklyn to Manhattan's squalid Lower East Side, he is forced to leave his carefree childhood behind.

Death in the Afternoon,Ernest Hemingway,3.68,"8,903 rating","January 1, 1932","Still considered one of the best books ever written about bullfighting, Death in the Afternoon is an impassioned look at the sport by one of its true aficionados. It reflects Hemingway's conviction that bullfighting was more than mere sport and reveals a rich source of inspiration for his art. The unrivaled drama of bullfighting, with its rigorous combination of athleticism and artistry, and its requisite display of grace under pressure, ignited Hemingway's imagination. Here he describes and explains the technical aspects of this dangerous ritual and ""the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick."" Seen through his eyes, bullfighting becomes a richly choreographed ballet, with performers who range from awkward amateurs to masters of great elegance and cunning.A fascinating look at the history and grandeur of bullfighting, Death in the Afternoon is also a deeper contemplation of the nature of cowardice and bravery, sport and tragedy, and is enlivened throughout by Hemingway's sharp commentary on life and literature.",496,"['Classics', 'Nonfiction', 'Spain', 'Literature', 'Travel', 'American', 'Sports']",28.9k follower,561 review,"1,698",210 (2%),747 (8%),"2,706 (30%)","3,240 (36%)","2,000 (22%)"

Plain Truth,Jodi Picoult,3.99,"182,707 rating","May 1, 2000","The small town of Paradise, Pennsylvania, is a jewel in Lancaster County - known for its picture-postcard landscapes and bucolic lifestyle. But that peace is shattered by the discovery of a dead infant in the barn of an Amish farmer. A police investigation quickly leads to two startling disclosures: the newborn's mother is an unmarried Amish woman, eighteen-year-old Katie Fisher. And the infant did not die of natural causes. Although Katie denies the medical proof that she gave birth to the child, circumstantial evidence leads to her arrest for the murder of her baby. One hundred miles away, Philadelphia defense attorney Ellie Hathaway has achieved an enviable, high-profile career. But her latest court victory has set the sands shifting beneath her. Single at thirty-nine and unsatisfied with her relationship, Ellie doesn't look back when she turns down her chance to make partner and takes off for an open-ended stay at her great-aunt's home in Paradise. Fate brings her to Katie Fisher. Suddenly, Ellie sees the chance to defend a client who truly needs her, not just one who can afford her.

As she peels away the layers of fact and fantasy, Ellie calls on an old friend for guidance.

The Acid House,Irvine Welsh,3.74,"16,581 rating","January 1, 1994","
Description from the inside sleeve:
This scintillating, disturbing, and altogether outrageous collection of stories introduces to these shores a young writer already being called ""the Scottish Celine of the 1990s"" (Guardian) and ""a mad postmodern Roald Dahl"" (Weekend Scotsman). Using a range of approaches from bitter realism to demented fantasy, Irvine Welsh is able to evoke the essential humanity, well hidden as it is, of his generally depraved, lazy, manipulative, and vicious characters. He specializes particularly in cosmic reversals--God turns a hapless footballer into a fly; an acid head and a newborn infant exchange consciousnesses with sardonically unexpected results--always displaying a corrosive wit and a telling accuracy of language and detail. Irvine Welsh is one hilariously dangerous writer and he is bound to create a sensation.

Opened Ground,Seamus Heaney,4.27,"5,704 rating","January 1, 1996","In ""Digging"", the first poem in Opened Ground, Heaney likens his pen to both spade and gun. With these metaphors in place, he makes clear his difficult poetic task: to delve into the past, both personal and historic, while remaining ever mindful of the potentially fatal power of language.Born and raised in Northern Ireland, where any hint of Gaelic tradition in one's speech was considered a political act, Heaney is all too aware of the dire consequences of speaking one's mind. Indeed, during times of crisis, he has been expected to appear on television and dispense political wisdom. Most often, however, he stays out of the fray and opts for a supreme sense of empathy to guide his words. As excavator--of earth, of his beloved Gaelic, of his own life--Heaney is unmatched. In ""Bone Dreams"", the archaeologist's task is synonymous with reaching for a cultural past: I push back through dictions, Elizabethan canopies, Norman devices, the erotic mayflowers of Provence and the ivied Latins of churchmen to the scop's twang, the iron flash of consonants cleaving the line.And in early poems like ""Blackberry Picking"", Heaney's images--deftly, delightfully--carry us back to childhood fields: At first, just one, a glossy purple clot Among others, red, green, hard as a knot. You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet Like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam pots Where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots. Round hayfields, cornfields and potato drills We trekked and picked until the cans were full... Opened Ground is a pleasure and a triumph. These three decades of work confirm Heaney as one of the most important poets of his time. --Martha Silano",443,"['Poetry', 'Ireland', 'Irish Literature', 'Classics', 'Nobel Prize', 'Literature', '20th Century']",947 follower,182 review,275,67 (1%),180 (3%),759 (13%),"1,843 (32%)","2,855 (50%)"

Next comes an Awakening, a time of spiritual exploration and rebellion. Then comes an Unraveling, in which individualism triumphs over crumbling institutions.

Wilson heroically claims that the power to create meaning resides in our mental and spiritual discipline. Examining the lives and works of Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Rilke, Shaw, Pascal, Swedenborg, Rimbaud and Scott Fitzgerald, among others, Wilson explores the main existential questions and shows how these remarkable writers, scientists, philosophers and poets faced their need for transcendence.

While Black women were aided by some activists like Sarah and Angelina Grimke and the suffrage cause found unwavering support in Frederick Douglass, many women played on the fears of white supremacists for political gain rather than take an intersectional approach to liberation. Here, Davis not only contextualizes the legacy and pitfalls of civil and women's rights activists, but also discusses Communist women, the murder of Emmitt Till, and Margaret Sanger's racism. Davis shows readers how the inequalities between Black and white women influence the contemporary issues of rape, reproductive freedom, housework and child care in this bold and indispensable work.",271,"['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Race', 'History', 'Politics', 'Theory', 'Social Justice']","6,152 follower","2,065 review",105,102 (<1%),248 (<1%),"1,573 (5%)","7,483 (26%)","18,553 (66%)"

Human Development as Described in the Qur'an and Sunnah: Correlation with Modern Embryology,Abdul-Majeed Zindani,4.20,20 rating,"January 1, 1994","The understanding that the human embryo develops in stages is a fairly recent discovery in modern science. Since the end of the 19th century, researchers have attempted to devise reasonably accurate terminology for classifying these stages. Until recently, it was not known to many Western scientists that the Qur'an and Sunnah, which are the sources of Islamic belief, provide detailed descriptions of significant events in human embryological development, and this terminology is characterized by descriptiveness, accuracy, ease of comprehension, and integration between description and appearance and main internal processes.This publication is a compilation of conference proceedings presented by renowned scientists and scholars in embryology, anatomy, and Islamic studies who investigated and compared the direct linguistic meanings of the Islamic terminology with the latest scientific findings. They concluded that the appearance of these terms 1400 years ago is astonishing, since it was impossible for this knowledge to have been attained through any human means, given the limitations of human scientific advancement and technology at the time. Furthermore, these terms, as explained in this book, can serve as valuable additions to the field of embryology.The relationship between science and religion in the West has often been characterized by antagonism, opposition, and hostility. In contrast, this relationship in Islamic society has been one of cooperation, harmony, and mutual benefit. The information presented in this book illustrates the clear support and encouragement provided through Islamic teachings for objective scientific research and is solid evidence for this type of harmonious relationship.",200,[],4 follower,0 review,2,2 (10%),1 (5%),2 (10%),1 (5%),14 (70%)

Their dead ends and diversions are the repercussions of haphazard decisions made by their unexamined selves. Battle-worn or overprotected, the travelers must navigate the ennui of their ostensibly peaceful surroundings. Peters does a remarkable job of capturing the motivations of both male and female characters, how they struggle to understand each other and coexist, and what territory can only be ceded in the gaps of understanding they encounter. What emerges is a striking representation of post-World War II United States, but the insights contained within are timeless. The Descent shows how catastrophe is a fact of life; that life is given to us on a silver platter, and what we do with it is up to us.--“Largely focused on the proverbial war of the sexes, with enough suspense and brilliant analysis to satisfy anyone familiar with Peters’ earlier outstanding novels.”–NY TIMES BOOK REVIEW","PaperbackFirst published January 1, 1952",[],5 follower,0 review,36,0 (0%),0 (0%),0 (0%),0 (0%),2 (100%)

Only the Paranoid Survive: How to Exploit the Crisis Points that Challenge Every Company and Career,Andrew S.

In Only the Paranoid Survive, Grove reveals his strategy for measuring the nightmare moment every leader dreads–when massive change occurs and a company must, virtually overnight, adapt or fall by the wayside–in a new way.Grove calls such a moment a Strategic Inflection Point, which can be set off by almost anything: mega-competition, a change in regulations, or a seemingly modest change in technology. When a Strategic Inflection Point hits, the ordinary rules of business go out the window. Yet, managed right, a Strategic Inflection Point can be an opportunity to win in the marketplace and emerge stronger than ever.Grove underscores his message by examining his own record of success and failure, including how he navigated the events of the Pentium flaw, which threatened Intel’s reputation in 1994, and how he has dealt with the explosions in growth of the Internet. The work of a lifetime, Only the Paranoid Survive is a classic of managerial and leadership skills.",224,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Management', 'Leadership', 'Biography', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Technology']",363 follower,454 review,31,247 (2%),485 (5%),"1,892 (20%)","3,347 (35%)","3,337 (35%)"
