Peace Is Every Step: The Path of Mindfulness in Everyday Life,Thich Nhat Hanh,4.31,"41,624 rating","January 1, 1992","In the rush of modern life, we tend to lose touch with the peace that is available in each moment.World-renowned Zen master, spiritual leader, and author Thich Nhat Hanh shows us how to make positive use of the very situations that usually pressure and antagonize us. For him a ringing telephone can be a signal to call us back to our true selves. Dirty dishes, red lights, and traffic jams are spiritual friends on the path to “mindfulness”—the process of keeping our consciousness alive to our present experience and reality. The most profound satisfactions, the deepest feelings of joy and completeness lie as close at hand as our next aware breath and the smile we can form right now.Lucidly and beautifully written, Peace Is Every Step contains commentaries and meditations, personal anecdotes and stories from Nhat Hanh’s experiences as a peace activist, teacher, and community leader. It begins where the reader already is—in the kitchen, office, driving a car, walking a part—and shows how deep meditative presence is available now. Nhat Hanh provides exercises to increase our awareness of our own body and mind through conscious breathing, which can bring immediate joy and peace. Nhat Hanh also shows how to be aware of relationships with others and of the world around us, its beauty and also its pollution and injustices. The deceptively simple practices of Peace Is Every Step encourage the reader to work for peace in the world as he or she continues to work on sustaining inner peace by turning the “mindless” into the mindFUL.",134,"['Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Buddhism', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Religion', 'Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Buddhism', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Religion', 'Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Buddhism', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Religion', 'Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Buddhism', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Religion', 'Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Buddhism', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Religion', 'Psychology']",11.2k follower,"2,303 review",956,543 (1%),"1,075 (2%)","5,159 (12%)","13,210 (31%)","21,637 (51%)"

Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics,William Lane Craig,4.26,"3,454 rating","January 1, 1984","Perfect as a textbook yet excellent for lay readers, this updated edition builds a positive case for Christianity by applying the latest thought to core theological themes.J. Gresham Machen once said, False ideas are the greatest obstacles to the reception of the gospel-which makes apologetics that much more important. Wanting to engage not just academics and pastors but Christian laypeople and seekers, William Lane Craig has revised and updated key sections in this third edition of his classic text to reflect the latest work in astrophysics, philosophy, probability calculus, the arguments for the existence of God, and Reformed epistemology.His approach-that of positive apologetics-gives careful attention to crucial questions and concerns, including: the relationship of faith and reason, the existence of God, the problems of historical knowledge and miracles, the personal claims of Christ, and the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus. He shows that there is good reason to think Christianity is true. As Craig says, If you have a sound and persuasive case for Christianity, you don't have to become an expert in comparative religions and Christian cults. A positive justification of the Christian faith automatically overwhelms all competing world views lacking an equally strong case.",416,"['Philosophy', 'Christian', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Theology', 'Nonfiction', 'Faith']",743 follower,198 review,119,83 (2%),113 (3%),432 (12%),"1,038 (30%)","1,788 (51%)"

As the Nazi Party solidifies its power in Germany, Lanny recognizes a golden opportunity to make a difference when his arms dealer father strikes a business agreement with Hermann Göring, Adolf Hitler’s second-in-command.   Robbie Budd’s alliance with the Luftwaffe commander and Lanny’s art world reputation enable the younger Budd to move easily among the Nazi high command and gather valuable information he can transmit back to those who are dedicated to the destruction of Nazism and Fascism. It is a dangerous—albeit necessary—game that Lanny is playing, and it will carry him from Germany to Spain on a life-and-death mission on the eve of the Spanish Civil War.   The fourth installment of an eleven-book series, Wide Is the Gate continues Upton Sinclair’s literary journey through the tumult of the twentieth century.

Pilgrim at Sea,Pär Lagerkvist,3.80,353 rating,"January 1, 1962","Benché il successo di Barabba e il Premio Nobel nei 1951 l’avessero fatto conoscere al grande pubblico anche italiano, Pär Lagerkvist è stato in seguito quasi dimenticato; lasciato in disparte dai flussi delle mode. Ma la scarna semplicità della sua lingua, la linearità delle narrazioni, la capacità di costruire sto­rie che, come Misteri medievali, hanno per soggetto le avventure dell’anima e per teatro lo spazio fra la terra e il cielo, pongono Lagerkvist nel numero dei «classici» per i quali giunge, prima o poi, il momento della rilettura. Due storie si intrecciano in Pellegrino sul mare: quella di Tobias, che parte per la Terra Santa imbarcandosi su una nave pirata, e quella di Giovanni, il vecchio marinaio che da anni percorre il mare perseguitato dal doloroso ricordo di una pas­sione impossibile. Ma esiste la Terra Santa? Esiste una pace, una fede che giustifichi la nostra vita? Esi­ste l’amore perfetto? Sullo sfondo della violenza e della brutalità della vita di bordo e dell’inquieta e indifferente presenza del mare, nessuna risposta è possibile. È l’assenza la condizione umana, la sepa­razione, la mancanza, come testimonia il medaglione vuoto che i personaggi di Lagerkvist si passano da un romanzo all’altro. I suoi ebrei erranti, le sue sibille, i vagabondi ricercatori di Dio e della verità, portano sempre dentro di sé quella nostalgia per una patria mai avuta e quella tensione verso un’improbabile terra promessa che sono nel fondo di tutti.",116,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Sweden', 'Nobel Prize', 'Swedish Literature', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Sweden', 'Nobel Prize', 'Swedish Literature', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Sweden', 'Nobel Prize', 'Swedish Literature']",285 follower,31 review,151,2 (<1%),20 (5%),113 (32%),130 (36%),88 (24%)

A Game of Thrones / A Clash of Kings,George R.R. Martin,4.54,"27,115 rating","January 1, 1996","2 eBooks in 1! George R. R. Martin, a writer of unsurpassed vision, power, and imagination, has created a landmark of fantasy fiction. Now his two epic works, A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings are combined together in this eBook edition. Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards who come together in a time of grim omens. Here, an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal, a tribe of fierce wildings carry men off into madness, a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne, a child is lost in the twilight between life and death, and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones. In the eagerly awaited second volume in this epic saga, he once again proves himself a master myth-maker, setting a standard against which all other fantasy novels will be measured for years to come. Time is out of joint. The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders--Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon--who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky--a comet the color of blood and flame--six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard's son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King's Landing. Robert's two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers. A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and warfare. It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel ... and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors. Audacious, inventive, brilliantly imagined, A Clash of Kings is a novel of dazzling beauty and boundless enchantment--a tale of pure excitement you will never forget.",864,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Audiobook', 'High Fantasy']",110k follower,668 review,"1,414",126 (<1%),260 (<1%),"1,822 (6%)","7,680 (28%)","17,227 (63%)"

Pillar of Light,Gerald N. Lund,4.30,"16,105 rating","October 1, 1994","""You believe me, don't you, Nathan."" It was not a question, but a statement, filled with wonder.It stunned Nathan.""You believe it all. I can see it on your face.""For a moment, time seemed suspended as Nathan probed the inward recesses of his soul. There was still the incredulousness, still the sense of hearing something that couldn't possibly be true. And yet he knew it was. He knew without the least shadow of doubt that everything Joseph was telling him was true. And so, finally, with a wonder of his own, he said, ""Yes, Joseph, I believe you.""Pillar of Light — the first volume in the series The Work and the Glory — begins the epic story of the Benjamin Steed family. In the 1820s they move from Vermont to Palmyra Township in upstate New York in search of better farmland. There they meet a young man named Joseph Smith and are thrown into the maelstrom of conflict and controversy that swirls around him. Did he really see the Father and the Son in a pillar of light? Has he truly been visited by angelic messengers? What is all this talk about gold plates and new scripture? In short, is he a prophet and seer or a monumental fraud? The answers each one gives to these questions — intensely personal, potentially divisive — will dramatically affect the lives of the Steeds forever after.Author Gerald N. Lund here masterfully weaves together historical reality and high-powered fiction. In his hands this combination seems to make the reader an eyewitness to the early scenes of the Restoration, thus deepening one's understanding and appreciation of those momentous events. The well-drawn plot and fictional characters present a moving, gripping story. Here are Benjamin and Mary Ann Steed, devoted to each other as man and wife, yet at odds over religion; Joshua, their volatile son, who rebels and heads for trouble; the sensitive Nathan, their second son, in whom Joseph Smith's message strikes a responsive chord; the beautiful Lydia McBride, who captures the hearts of both Joshua and Nathan.This book skillfully explores the inmost motivations of Joseph Smith and his early followers and the responses of typical contemporary families to the claims he made. These people come to life in this powerful historical novel, a story that captures both the heartache and the happiness that came in the wake of Joseph's experience with the pillar of light.",437,"['Historical Fiction', 'Lds', 'Lds Fiction', 'Religion', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Church']",699 follower,"1,018 review",62,141 (<1%),379 (2%),"2,097 (13%)","5,452 (33%)","8,036 (49%)"
A Day No Pigs Would Die,Robert Newton Peck,3.58,"10,069 rating","January 1, 1972","Out of a rare American tradition, sweet as hay, grounded in the gentle austerities of the Book of Shaker, and in the Universal countryman's acceptance of birth, death, and the hard work of wresting a life from the land comes this haunting novel of a Vermont farm boyhood.In the daily round of his thirteenth year, as the seasons turn and the farm is tended, the boy—whose time is the only-yesterday of Calvin Coolidge, whose people are the Plain People living without ""frills"" in the Shaker Way—becomes a man.That is all, and it is everything. The boy is mauled by Apron, the neighbor's ailing cow whom he helps, alone, to give birth. The grateful farmer brings him a gift—a newborn pig. His father at first demurs (""We thank you, Brother Tanner,"" said Papa, ""but it's not the Shaker Way to take frills for being neighborly. All that Robert done was what any farmer would do for another"") but is persuaded. Rob keeps the pig, names her, and gives her his devotion... He wrestles with grammar in the schoolhouse. He hears rumors of sin. He is taken—at last—to the Rutland Fair. He broadens his heart to make room even for Baptists. And when his father, who can neither read nor cipher, whose hands are bloodied by his trade, whose wisdom and mastery of country things are bred in the bone, entrusts Rob with his final secret, the boy makes the sacrifice that completes his passage into manhood.All is told with quiet humor and simplicity. Here are lives lived by earthy reason—in a novel that, like a hoedown country fiddler's tune, rings at the same time with both poignancy and cheer.",150,"['Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Banned Books', 'Coming Of Age']",70 follower,973 review,82,628 (6%),"1,048 (10%)","2,769 (27%)","3,110 (30%)","2,514 (24%)"

El tiempo principia en Xibalbá,Luis de Lion,4.22,137 rating,"January 1, 1997","Time Commences in Xibalb� tells the story of a violent village crisis in Guatemala sparked by the return of a prodigal son, Pascual. He had been raised tough by a poor, single mother in the village before going off with the military. When Pascual comes back, he is changed-both scarred and ""enlightened"" by his experiences. To his eyes, the village has remained frozen in time. After experiencing alternative cultures in the wider world, he finds that he is both comforted and disgusted by the village's lingering ""indigenous"" characteristics.De Li�n manages to tell this volatile story by blending several modes, moods, and voices so that the novel never falls into the expected narrative line. It wrenches the reader's sense of time and identity by refusing the conventions of voice and character to depict a new, multi-layered periphery. This novel demands that we leave preconceptions about indigenous culture at the front cover and be ready to come out the other side not only with a completely different understanding of indigeneity in Latin America, but also with a much wider understanding of how supposedly peripheral peoples actually impact the modern world.The first translation into English of this thought-provoking novel includes a conluding essay by the translator suggesting that a helpful approach for the reader might be to see the work as enacting the never-quite-there poetics of translation underlying Guatemala's indigenous heart. An afterword by Arturo Arias, the leading thinker on Indigenous modernities in Guatemala, offers important approaches to interpreting this challenging novel by showing how Guatemala's colonial legacy cannot escape its racial overtones and sexual undertones as the nation-state struggles to find a suitable place in the modern world.",147,['Fiction'],2 follower,17 review,11,1 (<1%),7 (5%),22 (16%),38 (27%),69 (50%)

Dragon's Teeth,Upton Sinclair,4.05,932 rating,"January 1, 1942","Pulitzer Prize Winner: An American in Germany fights against the rising tide of Nazi terror in this monumental saga of twentieth-century world history.In the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, Lanny Budd’s financial acumen and his marriage into great wealth enable him to continue the lifestyle he has always enjoyed.  But the devastation the collapse has wrought on ordinary citizens has only strengthened Lanny’s socialist ideals—much to the chagrin of his heiress wife, Irma, a confirmed capitalist. In Germany to visit relatives, Lanny encounters a disturbing atmosphere of hatred and jingoism. His concern over the growing popularity of the Nazi Party escalates when he meets Adolf Hitler, the group’s fanatical leader, and the members of his inner circle. But Lanny’s gravest fear is the threat a national socialist government poses to the German Jewish family of Hansi, the musician husband of Lanny’s sister, Bess—a threat that will impel the international art dealer to risk his wealth, his future, even his life in a courageous attempt to rescue his loved ones from a terrible fate. Winner of the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Dragon’s Teeth brilliantly captures the nightmarish march toward the Second World War. An astonishing mix of history, adventure, and romance, the Lanny Budd Novels are a testament to the breathtaking scope of Upton Sinclair’s vision and his singular talents as a storyteller.",836,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'War', 'World War II', 'Literature', 'Novels']","1,030 follower",104 review,643,33 (3%),45 (4%),147 (15%),321 (34%),386 (41%)
