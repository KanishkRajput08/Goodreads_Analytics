But in spite of that, she is drawn into a mortifying and oddly satisfying affair with an Oklahoman tourist who dresses more Bronco Billy than Beau Brummel.Also in London is Vinnie’s colleague Fred Turner, a handsome, flat broke, newly separated, and thoroughly miserable young man trying to focus on his own research.

The Diaries of Adam and Eve,Mark Twain,3.87,"17,046 rating","January 1, 1906","""Good deal of fog this morning.

Adam has a lot to learn about Eve, and even more from her, as she names the animals, discovers fire, and introduces all manner of innovations to their garden home. Mark Twain's ""translation"" of the diaries of the first man and woman offers a humorous ""he said/she said"" narrative of biblical events. The great American storyteller found comfort and inspiration in the company of women, and his irreverent look at conventional religion is also a thoughtful -- and humorous -- argument for gender equality.","PaperbackFirst published January 1, 1906",10.3k,17.4k follower,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Short Stories', 'Literature', 'Religion', 'American', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Short Stories', 'Literature', 'Religion', 'American', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Short Stories', 'Literature', 'Religion', 'American']","1,897 review","5,213 (30%)","6,123 (35%)","4,234 (24%)","1,186 (6%)",290 (1%)

Indecent Exposure,Tom Sharpe,4.12,"2,897 rating","January 1, 1973","Indecent Exposure , Tom Sharpe’s second South African novel, is a brilliant follow-up to his Riotous Assembly , which the Sunday Mirror called, “One of the most savagely hilarious satires ever, a startlingly original first novel.” Once again the setting is Piemburg, the deceptively peaceful-looking capital of Zululand, where Kommandant van Heerden, Konstabel Els, and Luitenant Verkramp continue to terrorize true Englishmen and even truer Zulus in their relentless search for a perfect South Africa. While Kommandant van Heerden gropes his way towards true “Englishness” in the company of the eccentric Dornford Yates Club, Luitenant Verkramp, whose hatred of all things English is surpassed only by his fear of sex, sets in motion an experiment in mass chastity with the help of the redoubtable lady psychiatrist Dr. von Blimenstein; their efforts are rewarded by remarkable and quite unforeseen results. Meanwhile, the Kommandant, riding to hounds in the Aardvark mountains, succumbs to the bizarre charms of Mrs. Heathcote-Kilkoon, as Luitenant Verkramp’s essays in counter-espionage backfire in the bird sanctuary. Once more, Konstabel Els, homicidal to the last, saves the day—or what’s left of it—in one of the most savage hunts ever chronicled in fiction. And if you’ve ever wondered why Tom Sharpe, as a young man, was deported from South Africa (but not before enjoying its unique prisons), you need only read Indecent Exposure and its companion, Riotous Assembly .",247,77,519 follower,"['Humor', 'Fiction', 'Comedy', 'Africa', 'British Literature', 'Modern', 'Literature']",109 review,"1,151 (39%)","1,080 (37%)",556 (19%),89 (3%),21 (<1%)
The War in the Air,H.G. Wells,3.61,"1,083 rating","January 1, 1908","* Illustrated  (This title belongs to the STEAMPUNK ADVENTURES series. The STEAMPUNK ADVENTURES comprise an illustrated selection of classic Victorian speculative fiction, with each title being chosen for its quality, modern appeal and resonance with the steampunk movement of retro-futurism.)  OUR AIRSHIP ESCAPADES into “a Dystopian Retro-Future which never was” continue in the epic Zeppelin war novel by H. G. Wells, THE WAR IN THE AIR. Young Bert Smallways, a brilliant mechanist and accidental aeronaut, finds himself as a reluctant stowaway upon the very same airship which begins the Great War. This is “dieselpunk” at its finest, featuring petrol-powered war machines, ironclads, bombardments, espionage, intrigue and daring adventures in the wild skies of the earliest 1900s. Smallways is swept away aboard the Vaterland, the flagship piloted by a belligerent German Prince, whose mastery of technology shall herald in a new age of war. How long can Smallways keep his identity a secret from the Prince? Will Bert survive THE WAR IN THE AIR?  (Astute readers may notice that this novel served as the inspiration for a certain steampunk trilogy with titles such as LEVIATHAN, BEHEMOTH and GOLIATH.)  Enriching and supplementing Wonderland Imprints’ well-received series of classic Illustrated Master Editions, the STEAMPUNK ADVENTURES series is devoted to reviving the very finest forgotten rarities which were originally published during the golden age of technology. The series explores the origins of retro-futurist elements, such as airships, mechanical men, goggled gentlemen of war, sophisticated adventuresses, gadgetry and weaponry, and global cataclysm. These are the tales of the Age of Steam, the lore of the ornate technology which reigned in a golden future that never was. Above all, this series is focused on telling great Victorian stories you’ve probably never heard of!  Episode 3, THE WAR IN THE AIR (inspired by the George Griffith works featured in Episodes 1 and 2, THE ANGEL OF THE REVOLUTION and THE SYREN OF THE SKIES), is considered to be one of H. G. Wells’s greatest novels. This Wonderland Imprints edition features over 30 illustrations, an active table of contents, 11 chapters, 98,000 words and 310 pages of mayhem, secret agents and aerial adventure.

James Thomson Callender, the ""scandalmonger"" of the title, is an ambitious gossip-peddling editor secretly hired by Thomas Jefferson as a political weapon. After carefully damaging Alexander Hamilton's reputation, thereby paving the way for Jefferson's success, Callender is shunned by the very politicians on whose behalf he was jailed for sedition. Broke and betrayed, Callender seeks revenge by exposing an illicit affair between Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemmings, an accusation that ultimately cost Callender his career and would not be authenticated for two centuries.By using actual letters, records, and notes to re-create dialogue and events, Scandalmonger embodies historical fiction at its best, politics at its most intriguing, and our Founding Fathers at their most notorious. For those who think that Washington sex scandals and lurid journalism are recent developments, this novel will be a revelation, for Safire shows how media intrusiveness into private lives-and politicians' cool manipulation of the press-are practices as old as the Constitution.",496,86,49 follower,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'American Revolution', 'Politics', 'American History', 'Adult Fiction']",53 review,101 (21%),209 (44%),128 (27%),23 (4%),12 (2%)

The Romantic Generation,Charles Rosen,4.35,198 rating,"January 1, 1995","What Charles Rosen's celebrated book The Classical Style did for music of the Classical period, this new, much-awaited volume brilliantly does for the Romantic era. An exhilarating exploration of the musical language, forms, and styles of the Romantic period, it captures the spirit that enlivened a generation of composers and musicians, and in doing so it conveys the very sense of Romantic music. In readings uniquely informed by his performing experience, Rosen offers consistently acute and thoroughly engaging analyses of works by Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Bellini, Liszt, and Berlioz, and he presents a new view of Chopin as a master of polyphony and large-scale form. He adeptly integrates his observations on the music with reflections on the art, literature, drama, and philosophy of the time, and thus shows us the major figures of Romantic music within their intellectual and cultural context.Rosen covers a remarkably broad range of music history and considers the importance to nineteenth-century music of other cultural the art of landscape, a changed approach to the sacred, the literary fragment as a Romantic art form. He sheds new light on the musical sensibilities of each composer, studies the important genres from nocturnes and songs to symphonies and operas, explains musical principles such as the relation between a musical idea and its realization in sound and the interplay between music and text, and traces the origins of musical ideas prevalent in the Romantic period. Rich with striking descriptions and telling analogies, Rosen's overview of Romantic music is an accomplishment without parallel in the literature, a consummate performance by a master pianist and music historian.",744,61,43 follower,"['Music', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Classical Music', 'Romanticism', 'Philosophy']",16 review,104 (52%),63 (31%),27 (13%),4 (2%),0 (0%)

Mary Bell, the younger but infinitely more sophisticated and cooler of the two, was found guilty of manslaughter. She evaded being branded as a murderer due to what the court ruled as 'diminished responsibility', but she was sentenced to 'detention' for life.Step by step, Gitta Sereny pieces together a gripping and rare study of a horrifying crime; the murders, the events surrounding them, the alternately bizzare and nonchalant behaviour of the two girls, their brazen offers to help the distraught families of the dead boys, the police work that led to their apprehension, and finally the trial itself.

The Uses of Literature,Italo Calvino,4.07,"1,077 rating","January 1, 1980","Italian novelist and short story writer Calvino has been accused of making protons, quarks and living cells talk as if they were people, but here he defends his approach as a kind of animism attuned to the way the universe works. His fascination with myth is evident in pieces on Ovid's Metamorphoses and the separate odysseys that make up Homer's Odyssey. Three intertwined essays on French utopian socialist Fourier present him as a precursor of Women's Lib, a satirist and visionary thinker whose scheme for a society in which each person's desires could be satisfied deserves to be taken seriously. In other pieces, Calvino brings a fresh, unpredictable approach to why we should reread the classics, how cinema and comic strips influence writers, and the cartoon universe of Saul Steinberg.

And he makes everyone else around him feel like smiling. He's the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet, a Nobel Prize winner, and an increasingly popular speaker and statesman. What's more, he'll tell you that happiness is the purpose of life, and that ""the very motion of our life is towards happiness."" How to get there has always been the question. He's tried to answer it before, but he's never had the help of a psychiatrist to get the message across in a context we can easily understand. Through conversations, stories, and meditations, the Dalai Lama shows us how to defeat day-to-day anxiety, insecurity, anger, and discouragement. Together with Dr. Cutler, he explores many facets of everyday life, including relationships, loss, and the pursuit of wealth, to illustrate how to ride through life's obstacles on a deep and abiding source of inner peace.",322,"1,098","5,712 follower","['Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality', 'Self Help', 'Buddhism', 'Psychology', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality', 'Self Help', 'Buddhism', 'Psychology', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality', 'Self Help', 'Buddhism', 'Psychology', 'Religion']","3,252 review","52,527 (45%)","38,760 (33%)","18,811 (16%)","4,122 (3%)","1,955 (1%)"

""] I had originally intended to treat this question in the space of a single volume; but the study swelled into two. I found that an adequate appraisal of these two competing theories of time requires a wide-ranging discussion of issues in metaphysics, philosophy of language, phenomenology, philosophy of science, philosophy of space and time, and even philosophy of religion, and that this simply could not be done in one volume. If these volumes succeed in making a contribution to the debate, it will be precisely because of the synoptic nature of the discussion therein. Too often the question of the nature of time has been prematurely answered by some philosopher or physicist simply because he is largely ignorant of relevant discussions outside his chosen field of expertise. In these two complementary but independent volumes I have attempted to appraise what I take to be the most important arguments drawn from a variety of fields for and against each theory of time.",272,119,743 follower,['Philosophy'],3 review,7 (41%),4 (23%),5 (29%),0 (0%),1 (5%)

""Whether slyly identifying irony as a white man's invention, or deftly moving from prose-like multilayered narratives to formal poetry and song structures, this fifth collection from poet, novelist, and screenwriter Alexie demonstrates many of his skills. Most prominent perhaps is his ability to handle multiple perspectives and complex psychological subject matter with a humor that feeds readability: 'Successful non-Indian writers are viewed as well-informed about Indian life. Successful mixed-blood writers are viewed as wonderful translators of Indian life. Successful Indian writers are viewed as traditional storytellers of Indian life.' Poems such as the title one, a haunting chant for lost family, and 'The Theology of Cockroaches, ' do some vivid scene setting: '...never/woke to a wall filled with cockroaches/spelling out my name, never/stepped into a dark room and heard/the cockroaches baying at the moon.' At times Alexie allows his language, within the lineated poems almost exclusively, to slacken into cliche. The opening, multipart prose piece 'The Unauthorized Biography of Me' is arguably the strongest in the book, juxtaposing roughly chronological anecdotes with 'An Incomplete List of People I Wish Were Indian' and the formula 'Poetry = anger x imagination.' Other poems tell of 'Migration, 1902' and 'Sex in Motel Rooms'; describe 'How It Happens' and 'Second Grief'; and develop 'The Anatomy of Mushrooms.' Alexie's latest is as powerful and challenging as his previous excellent books, and should only add readers to his ever-widening audience"" Publishers Weekly.""",91,130,"6,275 follower","['Poetry', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Native Americans', 'Read For School']",39 review,299 (43%),245 (35%),120 (17%),13 (1%),9 (1%)

Στη σύνθεση αυτή ο ποιητής, συνδέοντας με τρόπο προσωπικό διάφορα στοιχεία της ιστορικής παράδοσης και ποικίλους εκφραστικούς τρόπους, μας δίνει ανάγλυφη τη μορφή της Ελλάδας και των ανθρώπων της στον αδιάκοπο αγώνα τους για ελευθερία, δικαιοσύνη και ανθρωπιά.Το ποίημα αποτελείται από επτά ενότητες:Η ενότητα Ι αναδεικνύει την αντιστοιχία, τη συνάρτηση του ήθους τοπίου και ανθρώπων και την εμμονή της αντίστασής τους. Ο χώρος και οι άνθρωποι πολιορκούνται από στεριά και θάλασσα, αλλά η πολιορκία αυτή αναιρείται από ένα θαύμα που εξακοντίζεται στον ορίζοντα.Η ενότητα ΙΙ αποδίδει εικόνες της Ρωμιοσύνης στην καθημερινότητά τους αλλά και στη διαχρονική τους σύνθεση. Εδώ το τοπίο καταυγάζεται από την αρχετυπική παρουσία της γυναίκας, την Παναγία ""με τ’ αργυρά ματόκλαδα"", που συνυπάρχει πολύ ανθρώπινα με την κόρη του πεταλωτή αλλά και την ορφική μητέρα, τη Λήδα, ""που κλωσά τ’ αυγά του κεραυνού"", τη Νιόβη, με τα ""επτά σφαγμένα παλικάρια"" της, τη Σολωμική ελευθερία, ""που θα πάρει πάλι τ’ άρματα"" και την Περσεφόνη που μοιράζει σπορά και γονιμότητα. Όλες αυτές οι γυναικείες μορφές συγκλίνουν στη μορφή της μητέρας Ελλάδας.Η ενότητα ΙΙΙ τονίζει ιδιαίτερα τη διαχρονικότητα της ρωμαίικης ζωής και τη διαρκή αγωνιστική ετοιμότητά της.

Davis Bunn--and combining the engaging historical settings, rich characterization, and heartwarming messages quintessential to both authors, The Meeting Place is another timeless story for you to cherish.Set along the rugged coastline of 18th century Canada in what was then called Acadia (now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick), The Meeting Place re-creates a world that was home to native Indians, French settlers, and English garrisons. Such diverse populations did not live in accord, however. Instead, they were isolated within their own groups by a brewing political tension under the difficult English rule.Amid such chaotic times two women, both about to become brides and both trying to live lives of quiet peace, meet in a lush field of wildflowers. Louisa, a Frenchwoman, and Catherine, who is English, continue to meet secretly through the seasons, sharing both friendship and growing faith.The outside world does not mirror their own tranquil happiness, and the dreaded crackdown by the English throne threatens far more than their growing bond. In the face of a heart-wrenching dilemma, Louisa and Catherine strive to maintain their faith and cling to their dreams of family and home.
