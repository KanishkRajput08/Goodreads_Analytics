Britannia Mews,Margery Sharp,4.04,349 rating,"January 1, 1946","A passionate heroine defies the English class system in this novel set in 1875 LondonAround the corner from the elegant townhouses on Albion Place is Britannia Mews, a squalid neighborhood where servants and coachmen live. In 1875, it's no place for a young girl of fine breeding, but independent-minded Adelaide Culver is fascinated by what goes on there. Years later, Adelaide shocks her family when she falls in love with an impoverished artist and moves into the mews. But violence shatters Adelaide's dreams. In a dangerous new world, she must fend for herself--until she meets a charismatic stranger and her life takes a turn she never expected.A novel about social manners and mores reminiscent of Edith Wharton, this story of love, family, and the price one must pay for throwing off the shackles of convention is also a witty and incisive dissection of the ""upstairs, downstairs"" English class system of the last two centuries.

New to this edition are Freeman Dyson's comments on Sagan's vision and the importance of the work, Ann Druyan's assessment of Sagan's cultural significance as a champion of science, and David Morrison's discussion of the advances made since 1973 and what became of Sagan's predictions.

He traces the growth of the idea of God from primitive notions to universality.

""His estimates of western civilization are searching & some of them written in acid: one reads much between the lines-but Tagore recognizes the true strength of the west & the faults of the east. The lectures are actually a superb & haunting criticism & evaluation of life from the viewpoint of an immemorial philosophy by a wise man.""--Christian Century This is a book for everyone: a book whose human interest & pervading charm assure it a wide appeal & lasting value.

Its value is religious & poetical; like the essays of Emerson, it is primarily a document of the spiritual life.""--Journal of Religion ""Rich in profound thought & poetic speech--he has never written anything so penetrating an illumination on the nature of things¦ Tagore has seen visions, & he can paint them for us with a compelling charm due to utter simplicity & fidelity. But he has not stopped there. His reason hs entered into truth by the doors which his intuition has opened¦ A treasure-store of truth, beauty & wisdom.""--New Chronicle Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was the youngest son of Debendranath Tagore, a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, which was a new religious sect in 19th-century Bengal & which attempted a revival of the ultimate monistic basis of Hinduism as laid down in the Upanishads. He was educated at home; & altho at 17 he was sent to England for formal schooling, he didn't finish his studies there. In his mature years, in addition to his many-sided literary activities, he managed the family estates, a project which brought him into close touch with common humanity & increased his interest in social reforms.

He discusses how historiography subsequently developed and suggests how his portrait of the world's past in The Rise of the West should be revised to reflect these changes.""This is not only the most learned and the most intelligent, it is also the most stimulating and fascinating book that has ever set out to recount and explain the whole history of mankind. . . .

In other words, the esthetic world view serves as an instrument of domination. It serves the interests not merely of status but of power.

The central contribution of this book is Gebser's analysis of the history of culture -- mainly but not exclusively Western culture -- in terms of the predominance of different modes of consciousness. Gebser details five structures of consciousness: the archaic, the magical, the mythical, the mental, and the integral (or aperspectival). His theory seems to be that these structures unfold in a sequential but non-linear fashion (i.e. in quantum increases in the self-transparency of consciousness), and have different kinds of characteristic ways of experiencing self, other, and world. With each leap, the previous structures of consciousness are superceded and yet retained in a subordinate fashion. Meanwhile, the other structures lie largely latent and untapped. VERY briefly, the archaic is instinctual and primitive. The magical is tribal and involves participation mystique. The mythical is imaginative and often involves seeing through complementary polarities (darkness and light, good and evil). The mental is analytical, dualistic, and skeptical of the other structures of consciousness. And the integral structure allows for a re-membering of all of the structures of consciousness without the problematic reification of their respective ""worlds"". The integral or aperspectival structure additionally involves going beyond the previous four structures in something akin to Buddhist or Christian (a la Meister Eckhart) enlightenment as understood in terms of the perennial philosophy.",647,29,29 follower,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Spirituality', 'History', 'Religion', 'Metaphysics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Spirituality', 'History', 'Religion', 'Metaphysics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Spirituality', 'History', 'Religion', 'Metaphysics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Spirituality', 'History', 'Religion', 'Metaphysics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Spirituality', 'History', 'Religion', 'Metaphysics']",18 review,108 (71%),31 (20%),7 (4%),5 (3%),1 (<1%)

Flush with self-importance, he demands to see the king, but the king has just left for the south of his realm. Traveling through an increasingly phantasmagoric landscape in the company of a beggar and two roguish boys, Clarence is gradually stripped of his pretensions, until he is sold to the royal harem as a slave. But in the end Clarence’s bewildering journey is the occasion of a revelation, as he discovers the image, both shameful and beautiful, of his own humanity in the alien splendor of the king.Camara Laye published his first novel in 1953, the autobiographical L'Enfant noir (The African Child, also published under the title The Dark Child). It follows his own journey from childhood in Kouroussa, his education in Conakry, and eventual departure for France. The book won the Prix Charles Veillon in 1954.

Sir Gawain is a romance, a fairy-tale for adults, full of life and colour; but it is also much more than this, being at the same time a powerful moral tale which examines religious and social values.Pearl is apparently an elegy on the death of a child, a poem pervaded with a sense of great personal loss: but, like Gawain it is also a sophisticated and moving debate on much less tangible matters.Sir Orfeo is a slighter romance, belonging to an earlier and different tradition.

Hitler: 1889-1936 Hubris,Ian Kershaw,4.15,"6,360 rating","January 1, 1998","From his illegitimate birth in a small Austrian village to his fiery death in a bunker under the Reich chancellery in Berlin, Adolf Hitler left a murky trail, strewn with contradictory tales & overgrown with self-created myths. One truth prevails: the sheer scale of the evils that he unleashed on the world has made him a demonic figure without equal in this century. Kershaw's Hitler brings us closer than ever before to the character of the bizarre misfit in his 30-year ascent from a Viennese shelter for the indigent to uncontested rule over the German nation that had tried & rejected democracy in the crippling aftermath of WWI. With extraordinary vividness, Kershaw recreates the settings that made Hitler's rise possible: the virulent anti-Semitism of prewar Vienna, the crucible of a war with immense casualties, the toxic nationalism that gripped Bavaria in the 20s, the undermining of the Weimar Republic by extremists of the Right & the Left, the hysteria that accompanied Hitler's seizure of power in 1933 & then mounted in brutal attacks by his storm troopers on Jews & others condemned as enemies of the Aryan race. In an account drawing on many previously untapped sources, Hitler metamorphoses from an obscure fantasist, a drummer sounding an insistent beat of hatred in Munich beer halls, to the instigator of an infamous failed putsch &, ultimately, to the leadership of a ragtag alliance of right-wing parties fused into a movement that enthralled the German people. This volume, 1st of two, ends with the promulgation of the infamous Nuremberg laws that pushed German Jews to the outer fringes of society, & with the march of the German army into the Rhineland, Hitler's initial move toward the abyss of war.",912,77,939 follower,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'Germany', 'War', 'Politics']",240 review,"3,071 (48%)","1,959 (30%)",787 (12%),289 (4%),254 (3%)
