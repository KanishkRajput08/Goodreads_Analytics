In Inside Edge , Christine Brennan chronicles--for the first time--a season on the skating circuit, intimately portraying the lives, on and off the ice, of the sport's current and upcoming stars. Woven into the narrative are stories of figure skating luminaries past, present, and future--including Peggy Fleming, Katarina Witt, Brian Boitano, Scott Hamilton, Kristi Yamaguchi, Nancy Kerrigan, Oksana Baiul, Michelle Kwan, Rudy Galindo, and Tara Lipinski. Revealing the backstage conflicts high-profile figure skaters face, and the ambition that drives them, Brennan also tells the stories of their families, of improbable rises to the top, and of wasted talents.If skaters are perfect, they can become international heroes. But if they fall, if they miss a three-revolution jump on a quarter-inch blade of steel, the despair is theirs alone. This is their life on the edge, where decades of training culminate in little more than four crucial minutes on the ice. There is no other sport like it. There is no other story like theirs.The figure skaters gathered slowly in the mahogany-paneled lobby of the majestic Mirror Lake Inn in Lake Placid, New York, flashing no smiles, barely saying a word.

The Mass Strike,Rosa Luxemburg,4.18,382 rating,"January 1, 1906","La revolución rusa, que tiene sus comienzos en enero de 1905, sorprende a Rosa Luxemburgo en Alemania. Durante todo este año Rosa Luxemburgo se dedica a hacer comprender a los socialistas alemanes el significado de aquellos acontecimientos revolucionarios. En diciembre de 1905 decide partir para Varsovia para participar directamente, junto a sus camaradas de la socialdemocracia polaca, en los acontecimientos revolucionarios que conmovían el Imperio zarista. Fruto de esta experiencia es su libro Huelga de masas, partido y sindicatos, en el que elabora su doctrina de la huelga de masas.Para Rosa Luxemburgo la huelga de masas, , experimentada en una escala gigantesca, en esta primera revolución rusa, tenía el mérito indiscutible de llenar el vacío teórico que el fracaso de la Comuna de París y la crítica de Engels al insurreccionalismo (en su introducción al libro de Marx Las luchas de clases en Francia) habían creado en la concepción revolucionaria. Para ella la huelga de masas no es una simple «táctica» que debe ser utilizada por el proletariado para defender sus conquistas, sino, por el contrario, un elemento central de la «estrategia revolucionaria».

Alexander, the king of Macedonia and descendant of Achilles, follows in the footsteps of Greek legend. He has gathered a mighty force to liberate the Greek cities of Asia -- from legendary Sardis and Miletus to Halicarnassus. But vengeance is just one of Alexander's ambitions.Great oracles and loyal followers claim Alexander is more than mortal -- a powerful warrior, and insatiable scholar, a political genius. Yet,in battle after battle, one man blocks his way. Memnon of Rhodes, a Greek-born mercenary chosen by the Persian Great King to lead his vast army, is a cunning strategist who challenged Alexander's claim to the title of Lord of Asia. In Memnon, Alexander confronts an enemy who inspires his admiration. And in Memnon's wife, Barsine, he finds a woman who captures his heart.

Gifted Hands reveals a man with humility, decency, compassion, courage, and sensitivity who serves as a role model for young people (and everyone else) in need of encouragement to attempt the seemingly impossible and to excel in whatever they attempt.

Although on the surface, simians, cyborgs and women may seem an odd threesome, Haraway describes their profound link as creatures which have had a great destabilizing place in Western evolutionary technology and biology. Throughout this book, Haraway analyzes accounts, narratives, and stories of the creation of nature, living organisms, and cyborgs. At once a social reality and a science fiction, the cyborg--a hybrid of organism and machine--represents transgressed boundaries and intense fusions of the nature/culture split. By providing an escape from rigid dualisms, the cyborg exists in a post-gender world, and as such holds immense possibilities for modern feminists.

However, there is no doubt that The Old Wives' Tale is a superb novel of its kind, and it is still as readable and enjoyable as ever. First published in 1908, it tells the story of the Baines sisters--shy, retiring Constance and defiant, romantic Sophia--over the course of nearly half a century. Bennett traces the lives of the sisters from childhood in their father's drapery shop in provincial Bursley, England, during the mid-Victorian era, through their married lives, to the modern industrial age, when they are reunited as old women. The setting moves from the Five Towns of the Staffordshire Potteries to exotic and cosmopolitan Paris. It was fascinating to learn from Bennett's journal how he saw an old lady in a cafe and was inspired to think of how her life might have been lived, how she must have once been young.

"Catherine, Called Birdy",Karen Cushman,3.74,"41,684 rating","May 23, 1994","""Corpus Bones! I utterly loathe my life.""Catherine feels trapped. Her father is determined to marry her off to a rich man--any rich man, no matter how awful. But by wit, trickery, and luck, Catherine manages to send several would-be husbands packing. Then a shaggy-bearded suitor from the north comes to call--by far the oldest, ugliest, most revolting suitor of them all.  Unfortunately, he is also the richest.  Can a sharp-tongued, high-spirited, clever young maiden with a mind of her own actually lose the battle against an ill-mannered, piglike lord and an unimaginative, greedy toad of a father?  Deus!

Forever in His Arms,Penelope Neri,3.95,43 rating,"May 1, 1991","Whispers of war between North and South were riding the wind the summer Jenny Delaney fell in love with Tyler Mackenzie. But high in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, it was still possible to believe in fairy tale endings…even though Jenny knew in her heart that the blood feud between the Delaneys and the Mackenzies was as inescapable as the coming war. Time was fast running out for secret trysts and lovers' dreams, and she would have to choose…between the life she held so dear and the man whose passion made her burn as brightly as the evening star…",560,34,39 follower,"['Historical', 'Historical Romance', 'Romance', 'Civil War']",6 review,19 (44%),12 (27%),5 (11%),5 (11%),2 (4%)

Momente,Ion Luca Caragiale,4.16,"4,976 rating","January 1, 2000","Un clasic provocator, de redescoperit şi recalibrat cu fiecare generaţie„Momentele constituie o multiplă concretizare a faţetelor prin care omul are felul de a fi al «faptului-de-a-fi-unul-împreună-cu-altul». Aici e şi marea intuiţie a lui Caragiale. Această constantă reprezintă un dat originar, determinant nu numai, în particular, pentru perechea Mache şi Lache – «unul şi acelaşi în două feţe, doime de o fiinţă şi nedespărţită» –, ci şi pentru existenţa umană în genere. De aceea, individul Momentelor îşi trăieşte, în permanenţă şi cu febrilitate, sentimentul fundamental care nu e altul decât acela al aşteptării celuilalt, fiindcă spectrul singurătăţii îl umple de panică. Sugestiile de interpretare a Momentelor, venite din direcţia filozofiei existenţiale (în special a lui Heidegger), ne explică deplin şi cauza vitalităţii lor neîntrerupte, şi motivul pentru care ele transcend statutul de proză ocazională. În acest context, reproşul lui Caragiale la adresa incapacităţii contemporanilor săi de a-l recepta adecvat devine perfect justificat: «De Momente n-a spus nimeni un cuvânt, deşi e o carte europeană»."" (Ion VARTIC)„Caragiale e un om întreg, ştie ce e tristeţea, dezamăgirea, descumpănirea. Are pagini cutremurător patetice, după cum are pagini de un haz nebun şi de o devastatoare savoare ludică. Dincolo însă de umorile lui schimbătoare, de suişurile şi coborâşurile destinului şi ale firii sale, trebuie, cred, să ne veselim, clipă de clipă, de veselia lui, de râsul lui genuin, de aplecarea lui spre chef aşezat şi amuzament. Caragiale e, fireşte, un observator critic, un om al ironiei şi al deriziunii, dar toate pe un fundal de voioşie existenţială, de convivialitate tonică. Oamenii şi lumea îl distrează. Îi plac taclaua, anecdota, comédia vieţii.“ (Andrei PLEŞU)",288,143,161 follower,"['Romanian Literature', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Romania', 'Humor', 'School']",45 review,"2,272 (45%)","1,567 (31%)",858 (17%),232 (4%),47 (<1%)
