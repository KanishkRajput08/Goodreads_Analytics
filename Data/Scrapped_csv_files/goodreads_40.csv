A Murmur in the Trees,Emily Dickinson,4.15,65 rating,"January 1, 1998","Emily Dickinson is one of the world's best known and most widely read poets, though at the time of her death in 1886, only seven of her more than 1000 poems had been published. But shortly thereafter, the genius of her work was recognized and it has since received wide and consistent acclaim. Her verse - noted for its style, wit and bold and startling imagery - has greatly influenced the direction of 20th-century poetry. The 112 poems in this collection are taken from the definitive Johnson edition of her work and are accompanied by 65 pencil drawings, created especially for the book by Ferris Cook.",128,"1,353","5,860 follower","['Poetry', 'Nonfiction', 'Poetry', 'Nonfiction', 'Poetry', 'Nonfiction']",9 review,28 (43%),21 (32%),14 (21%),2 (3%),0 (0%)
A House and Its Head,Ivy Compton-Burnett,3.48,548 rating,"January 1, 1935","A radical thinker, one of the rare modern heretics, said Mary McCarthy of Ivy Compton-Burnett, in whose austere, savage, and bitingly funny novels anything can happen and no one will ever escape. The long, endlessly surprising conversational duels at the center of Compton-Burnett's works are confrontations between the unspoken and the unspeakable, and in them the dynamics of power and desire are dramatized as nowhere else. New York Review Books is reissuing two of the finest novels of this singular modern genius—works that look forward to the blacky comic inventions of Muriel Spark as much as they do back to the drawing rooms of Jane Austen.A House and Its Head is Ivy Compton-Burnett's subversive look at the politics of family life, and perhaps the most unsparing of her novels. No sooner has Duncan Edgeworth's wife died than he takes a new, much younger bride whose willful ways provoke a series of transgressions that begins with adultery and ends, much to everyone's relief, in murder.",291,23,102 follower,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Modern Classics', 'Literary Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Modern Classics', 'Literary Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Modern Classics', 'Literary Fiction']",113 review,87 (15%),192 (35%),180 (32%),75 (13%),14 (2%)

Since then, the New Republic has valiantly struggled to maintain peace and prosperity among the peoples of the galaxy. But unrest has begun to spread and threatens to destroy the Republic's tenuous reign.Into this volatile atmosphere comes Nom Anor, a charismatic firebrand who heats passions to the boiling point, sowing seeds of dissent for his own dark motives. And as the Jedi and the Republic focus on internal struggles, a new threat surfaces from beyond the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim--an enemy bearing weapons and technology unlike anything New Republic scientists have ever seen.Suddenly, Luke Skywalker; his wife, Mara; Han Solo; Leia Organa Solo; and Chewbacca--along with the Solo children--are thrust again into battle, to defend the freedom so many have fought and died for.

Democracy,Joan Didion,3.85,"3,438 rating","January 1, 1984","Inez Victor knows that the major casualty of the political life is memory. But the people around Inez have made careers out of losing track. Her senator husband wants to forget the failure of his last bid for the presidency. Her husband's handler would like the press to forget that Inez's father is a murderer. And, in 1975, the year in which much of this bitterly funny novel is set, America is doing its best to lose track of its one-time client, the lethally hemorrhaging republic of South Vietnam.As conceived by Joan Didion, these personages and events constitute the terminal fallout of democracy, a fallout that also includes fact-finding junkets, senatorial groupies, the international arms market, and the Orwellian newspeak of the political class. Moving deftly from Honolulu to Jakarta, between romance, farce, and tragedy, Democracy is a tour de force from a writer who can dissect an entire society with a single phrase.",234,92,13.3k follower,"['Fiction', 'Politics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'American']",390 review,948 (27%),"1,314 (38%)",922 (26%),210 (6%),44 (1%)

First published over forty years ago, it made its youthful author England's most controversial intellectual. The Outsider its an individual engaged in an intense self-exploration—a person who lives at the edge, challenges cultural values and ""stands for Truth."" Born into a world without perspective, where others simply drift thru life, the Outsider creates his own set of rules and lives them in an unsympathetic environment. The relative handful of people who fulfilled Wilson's definition of the Outsider in the 1950s have now become a significant social force, making Wilson's vision more relevant today than ever. Through the works the lives of various artists—including Kafka, Camus, Eliot, Hemingway, Hesse, Lawrence, Van Gogh, Nijinsky, Shaw, Blake, Nietzsche and Dostoyevski—Wilson explores the psyche of the Outsider, his effect on society and society's effect on him. Wilson illuminates the struggle of those who seek not only the transformation of Self but also the transformation of society as a whole.

But one treacherous winter night, in a house isolated by icy roads and failed telephone lines, Sibyl takes desperate measures to save a baby's life. She performs an emergency Caesarean section on its mother, who appears to have died in labor. But what if—as Sibyl's assistant later charges—the patient wasn't already dead, and it was Sibyl who inadvertently killed her?As recounted by Sibyl's precocious fourteen-year-old daughter, Connie, the ensuing trial bears the earmarks of a witch hunt except for the fact that all its participants are acting from the highest motives—and the defendant increasingly appears to be guilty.

Black Hole: A Graphic Novel,Charles Burns,3.85,"49,434 rating","January 12, 2005","Suburban Seattle, the mid-1970s. We learn from the out-set that a strange plague has descended upon the area's teenagers, transmitted by sexual contact. The disease is manifested in any number of ways—from the hideously grotesque to the subtle (and concealable)—but once you've got it, that's it. There's no turning back. As we inhabit the heads of several key characters—some kids who have it, some who don't, some who are about to get it—what unfolds isn't the expected battle to fight the plague, or bring heightened awareness to it, or even to treat it. What we become witness to instead is a fascinating and eerie portrait of the nature of high school alienation itself—the savagery, the cruelty, the relentless anxiety and ennui, the longing for escape. And then the murders start. As hypnotically beautiful as it is horrifying, Black Hole transcends its genre by deftly exploring a specific American cultural moment in flux and the kids who are caught in it—back when it wasn't exactly cool to be a hippie anymore, but Bowie was still just a little too weird.

An Experiment in Criticism,C.S. Lewis,4.20,"2,772 rating","January 1, 1961","Why do we read literature and how do we judge it? C. S. Lewis's classic An Experiment in Criticism springs from the conviction that literature exists for the joy of the reader and that books should be judged by the kind of reading they invite. He argues that ""good reading,"" like moral action or religious experience, involves surrender to the work in hand and a process of entering fully into the opinions of others: ""in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself."" Crucial to his notion of judging literature is a commitment to laying aside expectations and values extraneous to the work, in order to approach it with an open mind. Amid the complex welter of current critical theories, C. S. Lewis's wisdom is valuably down-to-earth, refreshing and stimulating in the questions it raises about the experience of reading.",99,"1,291",42.2k follower,"['Nonfiction', 'Literary Criticism', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Writing', 'Books About Books', 'Christian']",455 review,"1,248 (45%)",965 (34%),452 (16%),91 (3%),16 (<1%)

I Won't Learn from You: And Other Thoughts on Creative Maladjustment,Herbert R. Kohl,4.15,504 rating,"January 25, 1991","""I won't learn from you"" is Herb Kohl's now-classic essay about the phenomenon of ""not-learning,"" or refusing to learn, which takes place when a student's intelligence, dignity, or integrity is compromised by a teacher, an institution, or a larger social mindset. Available in book form for the first time, ""I Won't Learn from You"" serves here as a starting point for four new, groundbreaking essays by one of the country's leading thinkers on education. ""The Tattooed Man: Confessions of a Hopemonger"" is about the importance of teaching hope, and is Kohl's first autobiographical effort to discover in his own ghettoized childhood attitudes that let him recognize ""not-learning"" when he saw it among his students decades later. ""Creative Maladjustment and the Struggle for Public Education"" is inspired by Martin Luther King, Jr.'s call for creative maladjustment to an unjust society, and deals with the ways in which one can lead a positive life and learn new ways of maintaining opposition and resistance. ""Excellence, Equality, and Equity"" explores the relationship between these three crucial - and often confused - concepts. ""Uncommon Differences"" is about the way in which notions such as political correctness have been used to distract us from the central concerns of public education, including educating the poor, developing cultural diversity within the schools, and undoing the stigmatization of students who do not conform. It is about what public education in America can become. Written in Kohl's hallmark conversational style and employing the case examples that make his writing so compelling, these essays are at the forefront of current thinking on urban education.",176,64,17 follower,"['Education', 'Nonfiction', 'Teaching', 'School', 'Leadership', 'Education', 'Nonfiction', 'Teaching', 'School', 'Leadership', 'Education', 'Nonfiction', 'Teaching', 'School', 'Leadership']",57 review,209 (41%),191 (37%),79 (15%),19 (3%),6 (1%)

The Widgery Tribunal, ignoring the evidence, produced a report that cleared the British Army of any responsibility, again making a mockery of British justice as practiced in Northern Ireland.Don Mullan's meticulous research has seriously undermined the official British version of events.

After Virtue,Alasdair MacIntyre,4.18,"5,675 rating","September 28, 1982","When After Virtue first appeared in 1981, it was recognized as a significant and potentially controversial critique of contemporary moral philosophy. Newsweek called it “a stunning new study of ethics by one of the foremost moral philosophers in the English-speaking world.” Since that time, the book has been translated into more than fifteen foreign languages and has sold over one hundred thousand copies. Now, twenty-five years later, the University of Notre Dame Press is pleased to release the third edition of After Virtue, which includes a new prologue “After Virtue after a Quarter of a Century.” In this classic work, Alasdair MacIntyre examines the historical and conceptual roots of the idea of virtue, diagnoses the reasons for its absence in personal and public life, and offers a tentative proposal for its recovery. While the individual chapters are wide-ranging, once pieced together they comprise a penetrating and focused argument about the price of modernity. In the Third Edition prologue, MacIntyre revisits the central theses of the book and concludes that although he has learned a great deal and has supplemented and refined his theses and arguments in other works, he has “as yet found no reason for abandoning the major contentions” of this book. While he recognizes that his conception of human beings as virtuous or vicious needed not only a metaphysical but also a biological grounding, ultimately he remains “committed to the thesis that it is only from the standpoint of a very different tradition, one whose beliefs and presuppositions were articulated in their classical form by Aristotle, that we can understand both the genesis and the predicament of moral modernity.”",304,87,435 follower,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Theology', 'Politics', 'Religion', 'Classics']",493 review,"2,579 (45%)","1,921 (33%)",862 (15%),241 (4%),72 (1%)

Several stories, including ""The Poet,"" ""The Fairy Tale About the Wicker Chair,"" and ""The Painter,"" examine the dilemma of the artist, torn between the drive for perfection and the temptations of pleasure and social success. Other tales reflect changes and struggles within society: in ""Faldum,"" a city is irrevocably transformed when each resident is granted his or her fondest wish; in ""Strange News from Another Planet,"" ""If the War Continues,"" and ""The European,"" nightmarish landscapes convey Hesse's devastating critiques of nationalism, barbarism, and war.

Oh ! en compensation, il y a bien eu le troc proposé par Zérati, le copain de Jo, l'étoile jaune contre un sac de billes, mais leur père a compris: il faut fuir. Maurice, douze ans, et Joseph, dix ans, doivent rejoindre leurs frères Henri et Albert déjà installés à Menton. Ils auront à fran-chir la ligne de démarcation, près de Dax, sans papiers. Les parents suivront plus tard. Et la course vers la liberté commence. Elle les conduit à Men-ton, puis à Nice et son terrible hôtel Excelsior d'où, sauvés de justesse, ils s'en iront pour retrouver leur soeur Rosette près de Montluçon ; ensuite, ce sera Aix-les-Bains et « R ». Cela, c'est l'itinéraire. Le reste, l'important, c'est ce que raconte Joseph Joffo : les péripéties de l'odyssée des deux frères dans la France occupée de 1941 à 1944 - et le ton dont il rapporte ces choses vues et vécues : spontané, vif, ponctué d'éclairs d'humour en dépit de l'angoisse omniprésente - un merveilleux récit, un poignant témoignage.",414,49,60 follower,"['France', 'Nonfiction', 'School', 'History', 'Classics', 'French Literature', 'Historical']",450 review,"2,796 (31%)","3,556 (40%)","2,014 (22%)",404 (4%),119 (1%)

"Rue Ordener, Rue Labat",Sarah Kofman,3.82,291 rating,"January 1, 1994","Rue Ordener, Rue Labat is a moving memoir by the distinguished French philosopher Sarah Kofman. It opens with the horrifying moment in July 1942 when the author’s father, the rabbi of a small synagogue, was dragged by police from the family home on Rue Ordener in Paris, then transported to Auschwitz—“the place,” writes Kofman, “where no eternal rest would or could ever be granted.” It ends in the mid-1950s, when Kofman enrolled at the Sorbonne. The book is as eloquent as it is forthright. Kofman recalls her father and family in the years before the war, then turns to the terrors and confusions of her own childhood in Paris during the German occupation. Not long after her father’s disappearance, Kofman and her mother took refuge in the apartment of a Christian woman on Rue Labat, where they remained until the Liberation. This bold woman, whom Kofman called Mémé, undoubtedly saved the young girl and her mother from the death camps. But Kofman’s close attachment to Mémé also resulted in a rupture between mother and child that was never to be fully healed. This slender volume is distinguished by the author’s clear prose, the carefully recounted horrors of her childhood, and the uncommon poise that came to her only with the passage of many years.",88,36,11 follower,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Holocaust', 'World War II', 'History', 'France', 'War', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Holocaust', 'World War II', 'History', 'France', 'War', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Holocaust', 'World War II', 'History', 'France', 'War']",21 review,70 (24%),120 (41%),82 (28%),16 (5%),3 (1%)

A New World: An Epic of Colonial America,Arthur Quinn,4.22,79 rating,"January 1, 1994","""I write of peoples and of a struggle."" So begins A New World, an ambitious and extraordinary book that challenges conventional historical narrative by presenting episodes in North America's history through the eyes and voices of the Europeans who established the first colonial outposts here. Beginning with the swaggering John Smith at Jamestown and ending with the beleaguered Montcalm at Quebec, Arthur Quinn allows towering historical figures to emerge from an often beautiful, sometimes forbidding early American landscape and speak. An elderly William Bradford looks back with growing despair at the early promise of the Pilgrim colony at Plymouth. Governor John Winthrop tries to administer a dose of practicality to the Puritans of Massachusetts. Jesuit missionaries bring Christianity and disaster to the Huron Confederacy. A blustering Peter Stuyvesant watches Manhattan slip from Dutch grasp. William Penn's Holy Experiment in Pennsylvania goes increasingly awry. And, finally, the British and the French fight history's first world war for supremacy in the New World. Telling each story using the literary conventions of the day, Quinn casts North America's colonial beginnings as a multicultural epic, gripping the reader throughout with his uncanny eye and storytelling skill. The result is a history not just for scholars, but for all citizens of a nation whose birth came only through long struggle, and at a terrible cost to Europeans and Native Americans alike.",532,18,5 follower,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'The United States Of America', 'Historical']",12 review,35 (44%),28 (35%),14 (17%),2 (2%),0 (0%)
