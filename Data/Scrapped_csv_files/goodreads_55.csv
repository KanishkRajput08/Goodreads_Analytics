Early Visions is the first part of Holmes's classic biography of Coleridge that forever transformed our view of the poet of 'Kubla Khan' and his place in the Romantic Movement. Dismissed by much recent scholarship as an opium addict, plagiarist, political apostate and mystic charlatan, Richard Holmes's Coleridge leaps out of the page as a brilliant, animated and endlessly provoking figure who invades the imagination. This is an act of biographical recreation which brings back to life Coleridge's poetry and encyclopaedic thought, his creative energy and physical presence. He is vivid and unexpected. Holmes draws the reader into the labyrinthine complications of his subject's personality and literary power, and faces us with profound questions about the nature of creativity, the relations between sexuality and friendship, the shifting grounds of political and religious belief.",409,31,212 follower,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Poetry', 'History', 'Romanticism', 'Literature', '19th Century']",39 review,229 (58%),115 (29%),40 (10%),9 (2%),0 (0%)

Trying to found a dynasty against the inflexible caste system of the crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire, stern Jewish banker Zsignmond Ferenc had married Marta Bogozy, a gay, charming woman of noble birth. Their daughters, ""The two enchanting Ferenc sisters,"" Malie and Eva, are the most sought-after young women in their small society. Little do they realize that their secure world of privilege is soon to be consumed in the holocaust of the First World War and subsequent events.Masterfully, Diane Pearson interweaves the story of Malie and Eva with the lives of the other Ferencs, their relatives, and the history of the troubled times--the socialist, fascist, and finally communist regimes; the scattering of the family and its struggle simply to survive; and the joyous reunion after World War II of those who do.This is a superbly written, poignant epic of war and peace--the brave, dignified, and sometimes cruel story of living, breathing characters whose hopes, failures, and triumphs will entrance readers everywhere.",576,29,24 follower,"['Historical Fiction', 'Hungary', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Historical Romance', 'World War II']",109 review,480 (45%),347 (33%),165 (15%),40 (3%),16 (1%)

The Return of Lanny Budd,Upton Sinclair,4.35,220 rating,"January 1, 1953","Presidential secret agent Lanny Budd is called back into action in post-war Germany as the Cold War begins Since the age of thirteen, Lanny Budd has been more than an eyewitness to history. From the Paris Peace Conference to the Battle of the Bulge, he has played key roles in the extraordinary events of his age. Now, forty years later, Presidential Agent 103 is coming out of retirement to serve his country—and the free world—once more.   A counterfeiting conspiracy hatched by unrepentant neo-Nazis threatens to gravely damage America’s efforts to rebuild and stabilize a divided Germany. Lanny’s previous experience, as well as his unexpected connection to one of the chief conspirators, makes him the ideal operative to foil the sinister plot. But when he infiltrates the Russian-controlled sector, what Lanny sees makes his blood run cold. Communist leader and former US ally Joseph Stalin has twisted the socialist ideals he holds dear into weapons of tyranny, oppression, and terror. With the onset of a shadow war between two world superpowers, Lanny realizes that his mission is far from over.  The Return of Lanny Budd is the final volume of Upton Sinclair’s Pulitzer Prize–winning dramatization of twentieth-century world history.

James Joyce,Richard Ellmann,4.34,"2,747 rating","January 1, 1959","Although several biographers have thrown themselves into the breach since this magisterial book first appeared in 1959, none have come close to matching the late Richard Ellmann's achievement. To be fair, Ellmann does have some distinct advantages. For starters, there's his deep mastery of the Irish milieu--demonstrated not only in this volume but in his books on Yeats and Wilde. He's also an admirable stylist himself--graceful, witty, and happily unintimidated by his brilliant subjects. But in addition, Ellmann seems to have an uncanny grasp on Joyce's personality: his reverence for the Irishman's literary accomplishment is always balanced by a kind of bemused affection for his faults. Whether Joyce is putting the finishing touches on Ulysses, falling down drunk in the streets of Trieste, or talking dirty to his future wife via the postal service, Ellmann's account always shows us a genius and a human being--a daunting enough task for a fiction writer, let alone the poor, fact-fettered biographer.

God does guide His people, but the question is, “How does He guide?” After “putting out a fleece” to decide which college to attend, Garry Friesen began pondering why it was so hard to find God’s will when he had so sincerely sought it. Was he the only one who did not have 100 percent clarity for every decision? Then a new possibility struck—perhaps his understanding of the nature of God’s will was biblically deficient. Maybe there was a better way to understand HOW God guides.",528,9,5 follower,"['Theology', 'Christian', 'Christian Living', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Faith', 'Theology', 'Christian', 'Christian Living', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Faith', 'Theology', 'Christian', 'Christian Living', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Faith']",116 review,413 (45%),308 (33%),151 (16%),24 (2%),18 (1%)

[Johnson's] theme is the men and women, prominent and unknown, whose energy, vision, courage and confidence shaped a great nation. It is a compelling antidote to those who regard the future with pessimism.""— Henry A. Kissinger Paul Johnson's prize-winning classic, A History of the American People , is an in-depth portrait of the American people covering every aspect of U.S. history—from politics to the arts. ""The creation of the United States of America is the greatest of all human adventures,"" begins Paul Johnson's remarkable work. ""No other national story holds such tremendous lessons, for the American people themselves and for the rest of mankind."" In A History of the American People , historian Johnson presents an in-depth portrait of American history from the first colonial settlements to the Clinton administration. This is the story of the men and women who shaped and led the nation and the ordinary people who collectively created its unique character. Littered with letters, diaries, and recorded conversations, it details the origins of their struggles for independence and nationhood, their heroic efforts and sacrifices to deal with the 'organic sin’ of slavery and the preservation of the Union to its explosive economic growth and emergence as a world power. Johnson discusses contemporary topics such as the politics of racism, education, the power of the press, political correctness, the growth of litigation, and the influence of women throughout history. Sometimes controversial and always provocative, A History of the American People is one author’s challenging and unique interpretation of American history. Johnson’s views of individuals, events, themes, and issues are original, critical, and in the end admiring, for he is, above all, a strong believer in the history and the destiny of the American people.",1104,133,737 follower,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Politics', 'Reference', 'American', 'Historical']",271 review,"1,195 (42%)","1,024 (36%)",421 (14%),121 (4%),72 (2%)

As a result of this, an important American concert arranger makes an offer for Sebastian to tour America, accompanied by his father. The tour will finish in California, where a great violin master lives: the income from the tour will be enough to pay for lessons. At first Polly refuses, not wanting to break up the family. However, a new offer is made, for the whole family, and Miss Popple, to travel with Sebastian. David and Polly think this will be a wonderful experience for the children, so they agree.

Born in 1194, Frederick was the son of Emperor Henry II and Constance, Queen of Sicily. He inherited the Sicilian throne when he was only four years old and, in adulthood, the charismatic Frederick fought for control over the lands he considered his birthright to become King of the Germans and Holy Roman Emperor. At the zenith of his power, he crowned himself King of Jerusalem in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, thereby securing an empire which embraced vast areas of Western Europe and the Holy Land.Frederick was a towering figure of his age, but he was a man full of contradictions. For some he was a Messiah, an enlightened monarch and bringer of justice and peace; for others, a tyrant and a devil, bent on absolute power. He led crusades but was excommunicated four times. He was a warrior but also an influential patron of the arts. He welcomed Christian, Jewish and Muslim scholars to his court whilst persecuting Arabs and Jews in his Sicilian homeland.First published in 1927, Ernst Kantorowicz's stylish and absorbing biography of Frederick was one of the first examples of popular narrative history writing, and a classic of its time.

The Blue Flower,Penelope Fitzgerald,3.44,"5,996 rating","September 21, 1995","Penelope Fitzgerald wrote her first novel 20 years ago, at the age of 59. Since then, she's written eight more, three of which have been short-listed for England's prestigious Booker Prize, and one of which, Offshore, won. Now she's back with her tenth and best book so far, The Blue Flower. This is the story of Friedrich von Hardenberg--Fritz, to his intimates--a young man of the late 18th century who is destined to become one of Germany's great romantic poets. In just over 200 pages, Fitzgerald creates a complete world of family, friends and lovers, but also an exhilarating evocation of the romantic era in all its political turmoil, intellectual voracity, and moral ambiguity. A profound exploration of genius, The Blue Flower is also a charming, wry, and witty look at domestic life. Fritz's family--his eccentric father and high-strung mother; his loving sister, Sidonie; and brothers Erasmus, Karl, and the preternaturally intelligent baby of the family, referred to always as the Bernhard--are limned in deft, sure strokes, and it is in his interactions with them that the ephemeral quality of genius becomes most tangible. Even his unlikely love affair with young Sophie von Kühn makes perfect sense as Penelope Fitzgerald imagines it.  The Blue Flower is a magical book--funny, sad, and deeply moving. In Fritz Fitzgerald has discovered a perfect character through whom to explore the meaning of love, poetry, life, and loss. In The Blue Flower readers will find a work of fine prose, fierce intelligence, and perceptive characterization.",226,46,672 follower,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Germany', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction']",920 review,"1,155 (19%)","1,768 (29%)","1,956 (32%)",814 (13%),303 (5%)
