"O Shepherd, Speak!",Upton Sinclair,4.26,253 rating,"January 1, 1949","As Presidential Agent 103, Lanny Budd witnesses the collapse of the Nazis, the bombing of Hiroshima, and the Nuremberg Trials in this novel in the Pulitzer Prize–winning saga.   As a spy for President Franklin Roosevelt, Lanny Budd was able to infiltrate the inner circle of the Nazi high command and glean essential information on behalf of the Allied cause. Now, as the terrible global conflict approaches its long-awaited conclusion, the newly commissioned Captain Budd of the US Army is on hand to witness the final collapse of the Third Reich in the aftermath of the Battle of the Bulge.   The nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki brings World War II to an end, but not even the death of Franklin Roosevelt can release Lanny from his obligations as Presidential Agent 103. A devastated Europe needs to be rebuilt, and there is a necessary reckoning still to come in the heart of defeated Germany, where the fanatics who murdered countless millions will stand trial for their crimes.  O Shepherd, Speak! is the penultimate volume of Upton Sinclair’s Pulitzer Prize–winning dramatization of twentieth-century world history. An astonishing mix of adventure, romance, and political intrigue, the Lanny Budd Novels are a testament to the breathtaking scope of the author’s vision and his singular talents as a storyteller.",866,643,"1,030 follower","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'War']",21 review,114 (45%),97 (38%),37 (14%),5 (1%),0 (0%)
Simulacra and Simulation,Jean Baudrillard,3.99,"14,361 rating","January 1, 1981","The publication of Simulacra et Simulation in 1981 marked Jean Baudrillard's first important step toward theorizing the postmodern. Moving away from the Marxist/Freudian approaches that had concerned him earlier, Baudrillard developed in this book a theory of contemporary culture that relies on displacing economic notions of cultural production with notions of cultural expenditure.Baudrillard uses the concepts of the simulacra—the copy without an original—and simulation. These terms are crucial to an understanding of the postmodern, to the extent that they address the concept of mass reproduction and reproduceability that characterizes our electronic media culture.Baudrillard's book represents a unique and original effort to rethink cultural theory from the perspective of a new concept of cultural materialism, one that radically redefines postmodern formulations of the body.Sheila Glaser is an editor at Artforum magazine.",164,195,"1,628 follower","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Sociology', 'France', 'Politics', 'Academic', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Sociology', 'France', 'Politics', 'Academic', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Sociology', 'France', 'Politics', 'Academic']",770 review,"5,125 (35%)","5,313 (36%)","2,897 (20%)",769 (5%),257 (1%)

In this book, Yancey tackles the questions caused by a God who doesn't always do what we think he's supposed to do.Philip Yancey has a gift for articulating the knotty issues of faith. In Disappointment with God, he poses three questions that Christians wonder but seldom ask aloud: Is God unfair? Is he silent? Is he hidden? This insightful and deeply personal book points to the odd disparity between our concept of God and the realities of life. Why, if God is so hungry for relationship with us, does he seem so distant? Why, if he cares for us, do bad things happen? What can we expect from him after all? Yancey answers these questions with clarity, richness, and biblical assurance. He takes us beyond the things that make for disillusionment to a deeper faith, a certitude of God's love, and a thirst to reach not just for what God gives, but for who he is.",304,258,"2,225 follower","['Christian', 'Nonfiction', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Theology', 'Faith', 'Christian Living']",437 review,"3,101 (46%)","2,250 (33%)",971 (14%),249 (3%),143 (2%)

A Man Named Dave,Dave Pelzer,3.92,"33,214 rating","January 1, 1999","More About DaveA Man Named Dave is the conclusion to a trio of autobiographical books by Dave Pelzer, who to millions of readers of A Child Called ""It"" and The Lost Boy has become an inspirational figure. A Child Called ""It"" is the gripping and harrowing account of Pelzer's abuse at the hands of his mother, beginning when he was four years old and continuing until teachers and neighbors were finally able to intervene and he was placed in foster care at age 12. The Lost Boy picks up where A Child Called ""It"" leaves off and details Pelzer's experiences in foster care and his difficulty navigating the ""normal"" world with the dark shadows of his abuse and of his mother's actual presence in his life looming over him.In this installment, Pelzer narrates his life from his enlistment in the Air Force at age 18 to the present day. While all three books show the consequences of profound cruelty with a frank immediacy and gut-wrenching, carefully chosen detail, they are -- as the subtitle of this final installment of the trilogy suggests -- ardently inspirational works. Pelzer's thematic focus is forgiveness and the ability of the human spirit to triumph over adversity. Pelzer demonstrates that it is possible to channel feelings and experiences of trauma into positive energy.Pelzer includes just enough flashback and summary material that the reader new to his work has a complete grasp of the scope of his mother's abuse and his experiences in foster care. And those fans who have read his previous work will find A Man Named Dave to be an essential, capping complement to A Child Called ""It"" and The Lost Boy.A Man Named Dave describes Pelzer's more recent experiences and affords readers access to a more mature, gradually ripening adult perspective during Pelzer's agonizing struggle to confront the demons of his past and conquer them. To read all three works in sequence is, therefore, to experience a voyage from darkness with only a glimmer of hope to full illumination.Throughout A Man Named Dave, Pelzer carries with him a touchstone memory from his childhood, on which he ruminates and to which he returns in his most acute moments of distress. The memory is from his very early childhood, when he and his father had a tender talk alone during a family outing to the Russian River. This is an immensely precious memory for Pelzer, who has an abiding love for the father who mostly stood by or was absent during the long period of his mother's abuse. This treasured fragment from the past serves as a driving force in Pelzer's adult life -- he dreams of building a house on the Russian River and ultimately, living there with his father.Sadly, this is not to be. Pelzer joins the Air Force with the intention of becoming a firefighter, which, for a time, was his father's occupation as well, and while there, he writes letter after letter to his father, who responds only once, in a mostly illegible, scrawling letter that includes no return address. Pelzer fears that his father is lost to alcoholism and vagrant wandering. When Pelzer is finally alerted to the fact that his father is near death, he rushes to be with him. Pelzer's dying father is barely able to communicate, but in spending his final days by his father's side, Pelzer is able to begin to confront his childhood and to form a positive, productive link to his traumatic past. One of his father's final actions is to pass his cherished fire department badge on to his son.The death of Pelzer's father means that he must also confront his mother, who, though she would have little to do with her husband during his decline and death, makes her son feel ostracized and uncomfortable at the funeral. The full-grown Pelzer, an outwardly successful man in an Air Force uniform, must struggle to avoid becoming a craven boy in her presence once again. The narrative is punctuated with such excruciating encounters between Pelzer and his mother. Despite the fact that his mother no longer has any physical or legal power over him, Pelzer is still dominated by her presence. The scenes provide a telling portrayal of the consequences of childhood trauma and illustrate the almost epic immensity of Pelzer's ultimately successful struggle to overcome the legacy of his mother's abuse. Essential to this struggle is that Pelzer realizes despite the welling of powerful emotions inside of him, he must do all he can to not hate his mother or wreak vengeance on her in any form. If he is to ""break the cycle"" of abuse, he must confront his childhood and its effects on his adult life. It is this triumphal will -- to come to grips with his past and somehow transmute its effects on his character into a positive view of himself and the world he inhabits -- that forces Pelzer to seek out and speak with his mother despite his instinct to run from this past and hide it from others. In his depiction of himself as a young boy, Pelzer showed how he used indomitable spirit to triumph over tyranny. In A Man Named Dave, he will inspire most readers as he makes his voyage to adulthood and a fulfilling life -- all the while struggling with the legacy of his abuse. Part of this legacy is a difficulty with intimacy and attachment. Pelzer hides much of his past from his first wife, Patsy, and is unable to tell her he loves her. His self-doubt contributes to the tumult of their relationship, essentially a mismatch cemented by the discovery that Patsy is pregnant.Ultimately, the birth of his son, Stephen, is the final key to Pelzer's reconciliation with his past. Stephen is a constant reminder to Pelzer of the preciousness of life and the imperative of breaking the chain of abuse so that Stephen will grow up knowing abundant love. In order to provide this love to Stephen, Pelzer must learn to love himself as well.In a touching moment near the book's end, Pelzer walks with his son to the very spot where, as a child, he remembers walking with his own father many years ago and sharing in the natural splendor. The cycle of abuse has been broken, and Pelzer shares his quiet triumph not only with his son but also with his readers.David S.

These translations give a profound insight into the original poetry of this greatest of contemporary Latin American women. They were selected from her four major works ‘Desolación', ‘Ternura', ‘Tala', and ‘Lagar’.‘Desolación’ reflects the lonely, majestic landscapes of Gabriela’s native Chile, as well as her early years as a rural schoolteacher in the high Andean villages of the valley of Elqui. This book is passionate, personal, subjective; the pervading tone is tragic.In ‘Ternura’, Gabriela’s deep sense of the maternal is evident, as is her dedication to a lifelong vocation of teaching. With this book she created the first authentic body of children’s literature in Latin America.In ‘Tala’, there is a continuity of the themes found in the earlier works—death, grief, children, nature, religious faith, and a new heightened sense of hope, an ecstatic encounter with familiar everyday things, the mystery of the imponderable world of the spirit.‘Lagar’ was Gabriela’s last published book. In it she cried out against persecution, racial hatred, war, genocide—crimes perpetrated by man against his brother. She was quick to defend all who suffer injustice, and attentive to all who suffer pain.

We Think the World of You,J.R. Ackerley,3.62,569 rating,"January 1, 1960","This powerful short novel, with its extraordinary mixture of acute social realism and dark fantasy, was described by J. R. Ackerley himself as ""a fairy tale for adults."" Frank, the narrator, is a middle-aged civil servant, intelligent, acerbic, self-righteous, angry. He is in love with Johnny, a young, married, working-class man with a sweetly easy-going nature. When Johnny is sent to prison for committing a petty theft, Frank gets caught up in a struggle with Johnny's wife and parents for access to him. Their struggle finds a strange focus in Johnny's dog—a beautiful but neglected German shepherd named Evie. And it is she, in the end, who becomes the improbable and undeniable guardian of Frank's inner world.",205,18,55 follower,"['Fiction', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Classics', 'Animals', 'Fiction', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Classics', 'Animals', 'Fiction', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Classics', 'Animals']",73 review,102 (17%),226 (39%),178 (31%),51 (8%),12 (2%)
Contos de Aprendiz,Carlos Drummond de Andrade,4.01,268 rating,"January 1, 1951","'Contos de aprendiz', de Carlos Drummond de Andrade, foi publicado quando o autor já estava próximo dos 50 anos. Até então, o poeta mineiro nunca tinha se aventurado como contista. Essa edição, com novo projeto gráfico e prefácio escrito pelo escritor e jornalista José Castello, faz parte das comemorações do centenário de nascimento do poeta mineiro. O livro remexe em lembranças de infância, passando muitas vezes a falsa impressão de um livro de memórias. Se por um lado os contos reunidos no livro parecem simples, quase ingênuos, por outro permitem a fantasia e estimulam o imaginário.

Music in the Night,V.C. Andrews,3.86,"6,374 rating","January 1, 1998","Laura Logan dreams of a glorious Cape Cod day when all the dark secrets are swept away.... For Laura Logan, life on Cape Cod has been nearly perfect, full of magical days spent enjoying the sea with her beloved twin brother, Cary. But then, like the creeping of the tides, the vicious rumors at school begin — cruel voices saying unspeakable things about the Logans. Laura tries to ignore them, but not until handsome, gentle Robert Royce moves to their town does she feel truly carefree and happy again. While Robert's smile drives the shadows from Laura's heart, she still worries about Cary, whose gloomy moods drift in like the coastal fog. And then Grandma Olivia issues a chilling threat, forbidding Laura to see Robert ever again. Alone to suffer because of dark secrets no one will explain, Laura obeys...until the miracle of a glorious summer leads her back into Robert's arms. But dark thunderclouds have been gathering on the horizon, and when they suddenly burst with tragedy, they howl a name from the Logans' shameful past that plunges Laura into a silent, terrible agony. Now Laura can only dream of the warm, sun-filled life she so desperately desires....",320,325,"8,072 follower","['Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Horror', 'Romance', 'Gothic', 'Mystery', 'Chick Lit']",98 review,"2,107 (33%)","1,931 (30%)","1,761 (27%)",479 (7%),96 (1%)

Das Treibhaus,Wolfgang Koeppen,3.42,356 rating,"January 1, 1953","DAS TREIBHAUS bleibt der Roman über den inneren Zustand der Republik, die in Bonn als Hauptstadt ihren metaphorischen Ort fand. Koeppens geniale Metapher: ""Deutschland - ein großes, öffentliches Treibhaus"" traf wie kein anderer den Geist der Zeit. Und trifft ihn auch heute noch. Koeppen bleibt für mich der hellsichtigste und präziseste Schriftsteller der Zweiten Republik auf deutschem Boden. Wo Böll sich eher betulich auf einen moralisierenden Standpunkt zurückzieht, Grass sich über die Groteske deutscher Wirklichkeit nähert, beschreibt Koeppen erbarmungslos und radikal die innere Befindlichkeit der Nachkriegsgesellschaft, er beschreibt den Riß zwischen dem Individuum und dem, was gesellschaftlich verhandelt werden soll.
