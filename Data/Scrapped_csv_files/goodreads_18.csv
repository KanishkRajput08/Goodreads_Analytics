A Kiss of Shadows,Laurell K. Hamilton,4.02,"58,632 rating","September 30, 2000","My name is Meredith 'Merry' Gentry, but of course it's not my real name. I dare not even whisper my true name after dark for fear that one hushed word will travel over the night winds to the soft ear of my aunt, the Queen of Air and Darkness. She wants me dead. I don't even know why.I fled the high court of Faerie three years ago and have been in hiding ever since. As Merry Gentry, I am a private investigator for the Grey Detective Agency: Supernatural Problems, Magical Solutions. My magical skills, scorned at the courts of Faerie, are valued in the human world. Even by human standards, my magic isn't flashy, which is fine by me. Flashy attracts attention and I can't afford that.Rumour has it that I am dead. Not quite. I am Princess Meredith NicEssus. To speak that name after dark is to call down a knock upon your door from a hand that can kill you with a touch. I have been careful, but not careful enough. The shadows have found me, and they are going to take me back home, one way or another.So the running is over.

Knowing God,J.I. Packer,4.32,"57,738 rating","January 1, 1973","For over 40 years, J. I.

The Western Lands,William S. Burroughs,4.05,"2,078 rating","January 1, 1987","The Western Lands is the eagerly awaited new novel by the most visionary American novelist of the twentieth century—a haunting Book of the Dead for the nuclear age. Every new work from the pen of William S. Burroughs is an important literary event. This is especially so in the case of The Western Lands. For in this novel, Burroughs completes a trilogy that began with Cities of the Red Night and The Place of Dead Roads, with a profound, revealing, and often astounding meditation on the themes of mortality, loneliness, nuclear peril—and the inextinguishable hope for an existence beyond bodily death. The symbolic vehicle Burroughs uses here is ancient Egyptian mythology, a long-standing interest of his. ""The Western Lands"" of the title are the territory to which the Egyptians believed the souls of the dead made a hazardous pilgrimage in their quest for true immortality. The questers—Joe the Dead, Kim Carsons, the scribe Neferti, Hassan i Sabbah, the Old Man of the Mountain—travel through an unmistakably Burroughs-esque universe of appalling danger and otherworldly beauty—now the back alleys of ancient Egypt, now bombed-out Berlin, now the Old West of the shootists. Their hallucinatory journeys express the author's belief that only through facing the most extreme dangers and testing the possibilities of biological mutation can man escape a dead-end world of blasted dreams and atomic finale. And presiding over all is the haunting figure of ""the old writer,"" who shares in the fate of his characters in being finally unable to write himself out of Time, and into Space. The Western Lands continues and extends one of the great literary odysseys of our time, adding to Burroughs's awesome literary style and black humor chilling touches of elegy and autobiography. It is at once Burroughs's most personal and most universal work, yet another masterwork from the reigning genius of the American literary avant-garde.",258,360,"6,028 follower","['Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', '20th Century', 'American']",111 review,795 (38%),744 (35%),415 (19%),96 (4%),28 (1%)

Freedom at Midnight,Larry Collins,4.33,"10,275 rating","October 1, 1975","In this, the most sweeping, powerful and enthralling of their books, the authors of such worldwide best sellers as ls Paris Burning?, Or I'll Dress You in Mourning, and O Jerusalem! have re-created the majestic and tumultuous end of an era, when 400,000,000 people, one fifth of all humanity, claimed their freedom from the greatest empire history has ever known—only to find that the price of freedom was partition, war, riots and murder.Their subject is the eclipse of the British Raj and the birth of an independent India and Pakistan; the violent transformation of that fabled India—the land of maharajas with their palaces, vices, jewels and harems,-their gold-caparisoned elephants and their glittering private armies; the India of KipIing’s army, with its centuries of legendary heroism, its skirmishes along the Khyber Pass of the Northwest Frontier against the fiercest warriors on the globe, the Pathans, its young British officers commanding troops of a dozen races and religions and castes; the India of tiger hunts and pigsticking, of polo and memsahibs, of dazzling-balls and luxurious clubs; the India of astrologers and sadhus, holy men and strange customs; the India that was the heart and soul of an empire—into the new India of Gandhi and Nehru, precursor of the Third World.Their story begins in London on New Year's Day of 1947, when a black Austin brings to the door of 10 Downing Street the man Prime Minister Clement Attlee had selected for the task of cutting England's ties to her proudest possession, her Indian Raj. The choice could not have been more ironic. It fell -on Lord Louis Mountbatten, the great-grandson of Queen Victoria, the empress in whose name the empire had been assembled. The story ends just over a year later, at Allahabad, India, on February 12, 1948, as a man leans from a steam boat to pour into the Ganges the ashes of India's murdered liberator, Mahatma Gandhi. Between those dates the world had changed. An age, the Age of Imperialism, had passed and another had begun. An independent India had been born on a day cursed by the stars; the largest Moslem nation in the world, Pakistan, had come into existence; ten million people had been uprooted and perhaps a quarter of a miIIion killed in the greatest migration in history. At the center of their narrative are major figures of a drama: Nehru, the sensitive politician who prepared for greatness as India's prime minister in a British jail; Jinnah, a Moslem who drank, ate pork and rarely entered a mosque, yet who led 45 million Moslems to nationhood, proclaiming “We shall have lndia divided or lndia destroyed""; Mountbatten drawing up the plans for India's division, predicting as he did so that one day the Indians would “bitterly regret the decision they are about to take”; Gandhi, the gentle prophet of a revolution, who stirred the masses of the most populous area on earth without raising his voice, and humbled the British empire by refusing all nourishment except water and bicarbonate of soda.Weaving together the lives of people great and small, of statesmen, revolutionaries, politicians, ordinary men and women caught up in the triumph and tragedy of a world in upheaval, Collins and Lapierre have illuminated one of the great dramas of our time.

Time and again, Tom Clancy's novels have been praised not only for their big-scale drama and propulsive narrative drive but for their cutting-edge prescience in predicting future events.

In The Bear and the Dragon, the future is very near at hand indeed.Newly elected in his own right, Jack Ryan has found that being President has gotten no easier: domestic pitfalls await him at every turn; there's a revolution in Liberia; the Asian economy is going down the tubes; and now, in Moscow, someone may have tried to take out the chairman of the SVR--the former KGB--with a rocket-propelled grenade. Things are unstable enough in Russia without high-level assassination, but even more disturbing may be the identities of the potential assassins. Were they political enemies, the Russian Mafia, or disaffected former KGB? Or, Ryan wonders, is something far more dangerous at work here?Ryan is right. For even while he dispatches his most trusted eyes and ears, including black ops specialist John Clark, to find out the truth of the matter, forces in China are moving ahead with a plan of truly audacious proportions. If they succeed, the world as we know it will never look the same.

Butterfly was an immediate sensation when it premiered in 1988. It opens in the cramped prison cell where diplomat Rene Gallimard is being held captive by the French government--and by his own illusions. He recalls a time when Song Liling, the beautiful Chinese diva, touched him with a love as vivid, as seductive--and as elusive--as a butterfly.How could he have known that his true love was, in fact, a spy for the Chinese government--and a man disguised as a woman? The diplomat relives the twenty-year affair from the temptation to the seduction, from its consummation to the scandal that ultimately consumed them both.M. Butterfly is one of the most compelling, explosive, and slyly humorous dramas ever to light the Broadway stage, a work of unrivaled brilliance, illuminating the conflict between men and women, the differences between East and West, racial stereotypes--and the shadows we cast around our most cherished illusions.The original cast included John Lithgow as Gallimard and BD Wong as Song Liling. During the show's 777-performance run, David Dukes, Anthony Hopkins, Tony Randall, and John Rubinstein were also cast as Gallimard. Hwang adapted the play for a 1993 film directed by David Cronenberg, starring Jeremy Irons and John Lone.TEXT OF THE BROADWAY REVIVAL",72,44,102 follower,"['Plays', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Theatre', 'School', 'Historical Fiction']",572 review,"4,770 (33%)","5,148 (36%)","2,947 (20%)",893 (6%),334 (2%)

The book remains canonical today because the debate is still very alive.Rothbard opens with a theoretical treatment of business cycle theory, showing how an expansive monetary policy generates imbalances between investment and consumption. He proceeds to examine the Fed's policies of the 1920s, demonstrating that it was quite inflationary even if the effects did not show up in the price of goods and services. He showed that the stock market correction was merely one symptom of the investment boom that led inevitably to a bust.The Great Depression was not a crisis for capitalism but merely an example of the downturn part of the business cycle, which in turn was generated by government intervention in the economy. Had the book appeared in the 1940s, it might have spared the world much grief. Even so, its appearance in 1963 meant that free-market advocates had their first full-scale treatment of this crucial subject.

Er wurde zu einem Bestseller. Der Stoff wurde 1942 in einer Comic-Fassung und in der Verfilmung des österreichischen Emigranten Fred Zinnemann 1944 in den USA populär, noch bevor der Roman seine Leser in Deutschland erreichte. Von allen Werken der Seghers ist er unumstritten das bekannteste. Er wendet ein populäres, in der trivialen Unterhaltungskunst gern benutztes Erzählmuster an: eine Fluchtgeschichte. Sieben Gefangene sind aus dem KZ Westhofen entflohen. Sie haben die längst und eindeutig gegen sie entschiedene Machtfrage neu gestellt. Mit ihrer Flucht unterlaufen sie ihre Ohnmacht und nehmen für ihre Selbstbehauptung äußerste Bewährungsproben ihrer physischen und psychischen Kräfte auf sich. Aber nur einem von ihnen gelingt die Flucht. Sie habe mit dieser Fluchtgeschichte, sagte Anna Seghers, die Struktur des ganzen Volkes aufrollen wollen. Aus der Perspektive des sozialen Romans schafft sie die bedeutendste analytische Darstellung der nationalsozialistisch formierten Gesellschaft. Der Roman zerlegt die Motive der funktionierenden Mitmacher, der kalkulierenden Karrieristen, der eingeschüchterten früheren Oppositionellen, der Funktionsträger des Regimes und derjenigen, die dem Flüchtling helfen. Das Nachwort zur Entstehung und zur Rezeption macht deutlich, inwiefern Anna Seghers versuchte, einem Weltzustand, den sie keineswegs beschönigt, so etwas wie eine Hoffnung abzutrotzen, und wie das Gelingen des Romans damit zu tun hat, daß die Suggestion der Hoffnung ständig ihre Widerlegung mit sich führt.",416,135,103 follower,"['Fiction', 'German Literature', 'Classics', 'Germany', 'Historical Fiction', 'War', 'World War II']",188 review,922 (33%),"1,022 (37%)",558 (20%),157 (5%),54 (1%)
Laughable Loves,Milan Kundera,3.84,"32,779 rating","January 1, 1970","Laughable Loves is a collection of stories that first appeared in print in Prague before 1968, but was then was subsequently banned. The seven stories are all concerned with love, or rather with the complex erotic games and stratagems employed by women and especially men as they try to come to terms with needs and impulses that can start a terrifying train of events. Sexual attraction is shown as a game that often turns sour, an experience that brings with it painful insights and releases uncertainty, panic, vanity and a constant need for reassurance. Thus a young couple on holiday start a game of pretence that threatens to destroy their relationship, two middle-aged men go in search of girls they don't really want, a young man renews contact with an older woman who feels humiliated by her ageing body, an elderly doctor uses his beautiful wife to increase his attraction and minister to his sexual vanity. In Laughable Loves, Milan Kundera shows himself, once again, as a master of fiction's most graceful illusions and surprises.",287,192,17.2k follower,"['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Czech Literature', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Romance', 'Novels', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Czech Literature', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Romance', 'Novels', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Czech Literature', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Romance', 'Novels']","2,093 review","8,321 (25%)","13,523 (41%)","8,680 (26%)","1,815 (5%)",440 (1%)

E=mc²: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation,David Bodanis,4.10,"8,018 rating","January 1, 2000","E=mc². Just about everyone has at least heard of Albert Einstein's formulation of 1905, which came into the world as something of an afterthought. But far fewer can explain his insightful linkage of energy to mass. David Bodanis offers an easily grasped gloss on the equation. Mass, he writes, ""is simply the ultimate type of condensed or concentrated energy,"" whereas energy ""is what billows out as an alternate form of mass under the right circumstances."" Just what those circumstances are occupies much of Bodanis's book, which pays homage to Einstein and, just as important, to predecessors such as Maxwell, Faraday, and Lavoisier, who are not as well known as Einstein today. Balancing writerly energy and scholarly weight, Bodanis offers a primer in modern physics and cosmology, explaining that the universe today is an expression of mass that will, in some vastly distant future, one day slide back to the energy side of the equation, replacing the ""dominion of matter"" with ""a great stillness""--a vision that is at once lovely and profoundly frightening. Without sliding into easy psychobiography, Bodanis explores other circumstances as well; namely, Einstein's background and character, which combined with a sterling intelligence to afford him an idiosyncratic view of the way things work--a view that would change the world. --Gregory McNamee",337,25,140 follower,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Physics', 'Biography', 'Popular Science', 'Mathematics']",477 review,"3,164 (39%)","2,978 (37%)","1,493 (18%)",278 (3%),105 (1%)
