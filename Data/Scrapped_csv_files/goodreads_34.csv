A Lost Lady,Willa Cather,3.72,"7,077 rating","January 1, 1923","Marian Forrester is the symbolic flower of the Old American West. She draws her strength from that solid foundation, bringing delight and beauty to her elderly husband, to the small town of Sweet Water where they live, to the prairie land itself, and to the young narrator of her story, Neil Herbert. All are bewitched by her brilliance and grace, and all are ultimately betrayed. For Marian longs for ""life on any terms,"" and in fulfilling herself, she loses all she loved and all who loved her.

Return to Nevèrÿon,Samuel R. Delany,4.01,377 rating,"November 1, 1987","In his four-volume series Return to Nevèrÿon, Hugo and Nebula award-winner Samuel R. Delany appropriated the conceits of sword-and-sorcery fantasy to explore his characteristic themes of language, power, gender, and the nature of civilization. Wesleyan University Press has reissued the long-unavailable Nevèrÿon volumes in trade paperback. The eleven stories, novellas, and novels in Return to Nevèrÿon's four volumes chronicle a long-ago land on civilization's brink, perhaps in Asia or Africa, or even on the Mediterranean. Taken slave in childhood, Gorgik gains his freedom, leads a slave revolt, and becomes a minister of state, finally abolishing slavery. Ironically, however, he is sexually aroused by the iron slave collars of servitude. Does this contaminate his mission - or intensify it?

On all sides, however, developments of one kind or another have gradually moved in, so that now the central and integral forest is reduced to about a thousand square miles. Although New Jersey has the heaviest population density of any state, huge segments of the Pine Barrens remain uninhabited.

Then, when desperation sets in, Candy will stop at nothing to secure a blast, as she and her lover become hostage to the nightmarish world of addiction.Painful, sexy, tender, and charged with dark humor, Candy provocatively charts the daily rituals of two lovers maintaining a long-term junk habit.

Kirinyaga,Mike Resnick,3.99,"1,117 rating","November 1, 1988","Hailed for his grandeur of imagination and superb worldbuilding, winner of and nominee for more than fifty awards for his outstanding work, Mike Resnick has rightfully won a place as one of science fiction's master storytellers. Now, in Kirinyaga, Resnick presents the haunting and utterly compelling tale of one man's utopia.By the twentieth second century in the African nation of Kenya, polluted cities sprawl up the flanks of sacred Mount Kirinyaga. Great animal herds are but distant memories. European crops now grow on the sweeping savannas. But Koriba, a distinguished, educated man of Kikuyu ancestry, knows that life was different for his people centuries ago--and he is determined to build a utopian colony, not on earth, but on the terraformed planetoid he proudly names Kirinyaga.As the mundumugu--witch doctor--Koriba leads the colonists. Reinstating the ancient customs and stringent laws of the Kikuyu people, he alone decides their fate. He must face many challenges to the struggling colony's from a brilliant young girl whose radiant intellect could threaten their traditional ways to the interference of ""Maintenance"" which holds the power to revoke the colony's charter. All the while, only Koriba--unbeknownst to his people--maintains the computer link to the rest of humanity.Ironically, the Kirinyaga experiment threatens to collapse--not from violence or greed--but from humankind's insatiable desire for knowledge. The Kikuyu people can no more stand still in time than their planet can stop revolving around its sun.Deeply moving, swiftly paced, and profound in its implications, Kirinyaga is Mike Resnick's most triumphant work to date. His Fable of Utopia is the book every science fiction reader will want to own and savor for years to come.",293,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Fantasy', 'Africa', 'Utopia', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']",530 follower,151 review,755,20 (1%),57 (5%),227 (20%),418 (37%),395 (35%)

Naming and defining the alienating features of everyday life in consumer society: survival rather than living in full, the call to sacrifice, the cultivation of false needs, the dictatorship of the commodity, subjection to social roles, and the replacement of God by the economy, the book argues that the countervailing impulses that exist within deep alienation - creativity, spontaneity, poetry present an authentic alternative to nilhilistic consumerism.

Along the way, the book addresses the flip side of compassionate listening; squabbles about victimhood and recovered memory. The book concludes that, as thinking and caring inhabitants of a menacing world, we must all learn to hear unspeakable truths. At the same time that we risk accepting the truths about violence and degradation that survivors' memories hold, we must reasonably engage critical thinking when memories of violence and degradation stretch the limits of our credulity.

Then, to make matters worse, he drops off Nicolas but forgets to take his son's suitcase out of the trunk, reducing Nicolas to begging the other children for such bare essentials as a toothbrush and pajamas (a source of particular tension since Nicolas is still accident-prone at night).Faithful to the strict logic that governs a child's mind, Carrere recounts Nicolas's feverish fantasies stoked by the lurid tales of kidnapping and organ theft he has been told by his father. The fantasies grow frighteningly real when a child from the local village disappears. Sure that the child has fallen victim to one of the organ bandits his father always warns him about, Nicolas convinces a classmate to help him investigate the matter in the best heroic school-boy style.

Astfel, de la disciplina penitenciara, in fapt o terifianta batjocura la adresa condamnatilor, actiunea este translatata spre o ""paranghelie cazona"". De la arestarea unei batranici, care va fi condamnata la moarte pentru ofensa la adresa Fuhrerului, se ajunge la intalnirea a doi afaceristi in uniforma – Porta si trompetul-cavalerist Rudolf Kleber, care, suprem argument, i-a cantat lui Hitler. Trocul cu tigari cu opiu contra poze porno e savuros, portretele celor doua personaje fiind creionate cu un indiscutabil umor (amintind de Hasek si al sau brav soldat Swejk).Hassel reuseste, de asemenea, o paralela socanta intre teroarea de tip Gestapo si aceea, cu nimic mai prejos, practicata de NKVD-ul sovietic. Ceea ce ii induce cititorului credinta ca intre svastica si crucea verde a comisarilor sovietici au existat doar deosebiri de nuanta.

Bittersweet,Danielle Steel,3.87,"6,144 rating","January 1, 1999","In Bittersweet, Danielle Steel has written a novel for our times, a story of choices and new beginnings.India Taylor lived in a world of manicured lawns and neatly maintained calendars: a merry-go-round of Little League, piano lessons, and Cape Cod summer vacations. With four wonderful children, India believed in commitment and sacrifice, just as she believed in Doug, the man she married 17 years before. For India, this was the promise she made, the life she had chosen--not the award-winning career as a photojournalist she once had. It was a choice she had never truly regretted. Until she begins to regret it with all her heart.India couldn't pinpoint the exact moment. Perhaps it was the last time her agent called, begging her to take an assignment Doug insisted she turn down. Or perhaps it was when Doug told her he thought of her as a companion and someone to take care of their kids, and not much more. At that moment, the price of the sacrifices she'd made began to seem high.And then, she met Paul Ward. A Wall Street tycoon married to a bestselling author, Paul lived life on his own terms, traveling the world on his own yacht. India hadn't planned to become Paul's friend. Anything more was unthinkable. Yet talking to Paul was so easy. India could share her dreams with him, and offer comfort when Paul suffers a heartbreak of his own. And while Paul urges India to reclaim her career, Doug is adamantly against it, determined to keep her tied to the home. But with Paul's encouragement, India slowly, painfully, begins to break free, and find herself again.Rediscovering her creativity and her courage, India uses Paul like a beacon on the horizon, sharing intimate phone conversations with a man half a world away, a man who never stops reminding her of all that is possible for her. India is changing, and nothing in her life will ever be the same again. Not her marriage. Not her friendship with Paul. And when India is presented with an irresistible opportunity, she makes a heart-wrenching decision, leaving a safe, familiar place-and the people she loves there-to move into the terror of the unknown.Bittersweet is her story, a story of freedom, of having dreams and making choices to find them. With unerring insight, Danielle Steel has created a moving portrait of a woman who dares to embark on a new adventure and the man who helps her get there.

All these attractive, intelligent and fully occupied people are seemingly untroubled. But the surface of their lives is deceptive.All, even the lively teenagers, have unusual problems which are only brought fully to light after the Quentins return to the London theatre world and the Thorntons to their Westminster house. Then the story becomes a far from conventional love story in which loyalty may prove more important than love; or it could be described as a story of different kinds of love. Few readers of its early sunny chapters will foresee its dramatic development, the outcome of which is uncertain until the very end.

Expelled from the Soviet Union, Serge went to Paris, where he evaded the KGB and the Nazis before fleeing to Mexico.
