The War Against Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men,Christina Hoff Sommers,3.93,"1,515 rating","January 1, 2000","Despite popular belief, American boys tag behind girls in reading and writing ability, and they are less likely to go to college. Our young men are greatly at risk, yet the best-known studies and experts insist that it's girls who are in need of our attention. The highly publicized ""girl crisis"" has led to many changes in American schools, politics, and parenting...but at what cost? In this provocative book, Christina Hoff Sommers argues that our society has continued to overemphasize the troubles of girls while our boys suffer from the same self-esteem and academic problems. Boys need help, but not the sort of help they've been getting.",256,16,302 follower,"['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Feminism', 'Sociology', 'Education', 'Parenting', 'Philosophy']",222 review,509 (33%),575 (37%),292 (19%),90 (5%),49 (3%)

Gain,Richard Powers,3.76,"1,129 rating","January 1, 1998","FROM THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE SHORTLISTED AUTHOR OF THE OVERSTORYRichard Powers' novel is a fascinating and profound exploration of the interaction of an individual human life and a corporate one. It tells two stories: the first that of an American company, which starts as a small family soap and candle-making firm in the early 1800s, and ends as a vast pharmaceuticals-to-pesticides combine in the 1990s. The second is that of a contemporary woman, living in the company town, who during the course of the novel is diagnosed and then finally dies of cancer, a cancer that is almost certainly caused by exposure to chemical wastes from the company's factories.Richly intellectually stimulating, deeply moving and beautifully written, Gain is very much a 'Great American Novel', an exploration of the history, uniqueness and soul of America, in the tradition of Underworld. But it is most reminiscent of Graham Swift's Waterland, another novel that combines history, both public and private, with contemporary lives, showing how individuals are both the victims and shapers of large-scale historical and economic forces",355,348,"4,662 follower","['Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'The United States Of America', 'Health', 'American', 'Historical Fiction']",115 review,274 (24%),457 (40%),285 (25%),77 (6%),36 (3%)

"Marxism, Freedom and the State",Mikhail Bakunin,3.62,155 rating,"January 1, 1950","Marxism, Freedom and the State is a collection of essays and letters by the Russian anarchist philosopher and revolutionary, Mikhail Bakunin. In this book, Bakunin critiques the ideology of Marxism, arguing that it ultimately leads to a dictatorship of the proletariat and the concentration of power in the state. He advocates for a decentralized, anarchist society that prioritizes individual freedom and direct democracy.Bakunin's writings cover a range of topics, including his disagreements with Karl Marx and the First International, his views on the role of the state and the need for revolutionary action, and his vision for a society based on mutual aid and cooperation. He also discusses the relationship between anarchism and other political ideologies, such as socialism and liberalism.Marxism, Freedom and the State is an important work in the history of anarchist thought, and remains relevant to contemporary debates about the role of the state, the nature of power, and the possibilities for radical social change.Its principal point is the conquest of political power by the working class. One can understand that men as indispensable as Marx and Engels should be the partisans of a programme which, consecrating and approving political power, opens the door to all ambitions. Since there will be political power there will necessarily be subjects, got up in Republican fashion, as citizens, it is true, but who will none the less be subjects, and who as such will be forced to obey.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations.

Together the captains kept this journal: a richly detailed record of the flora and fauna they sighted, the native tribes they encountered, and the awe-inspiring landscape they traversed, from their base camp near present-day St. Louis to the mouth of the Columbia River, that has become an incomparable contribution to the literature of exploration and the writing of natural history.",576,231,29 follower,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'American History', 'Adventure', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'American History', 'Adventure', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'American History', 'Adventure', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'American History', 'Adventure', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'American History', 'Adventure', 'Biography', 'Classics']",244 review,"2,127 (40%)","1,874 (36%)",949 (18%),178 (3%),76 (1%)

Our Heritage: A Brief History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,4.30,"3,668 rating","January 1, 1980","The central message of this book is the message declared by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since its beginning. Joseph Smith, the first prophet of this dispensation, taught:“The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.”Every prophet who has succeeded Joseph Smith has added his personal witness of the divine mission of the Savior. The First Presidency affirmed:“As those who are called and ordained to bear witness of Jesus Christ to all the world, we testify that He was resurrected on that Easter morning nearly two thousand years ago, and that He lives today. He has a glorified, immortal body of flesh and bones. He is the Savior, the Light and Life of the world.”Millions of faithful Saints have also had testimonies of the divinity of Jesus Christ. This knowledge has motivated them to make the sacrifices necessary to build The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the kingdom of God on the earth. The story of the establishment of the Church is one of faith, consecration, and joy. It is the story of living prophets who taught the truths of God to the modern world. It is the story of men and women from all walks of life who sought for the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and, upon finding it, were willing to pay the price of becoming the Savior’s disciples. These stalwart Saints pressed on through sufferings and hardships, witnessing even in their darkest hours of the goodness of God and the joy of his love. They have left a legacy of faith, courage, obedience, and sacrifice.The heritage of faith continues today. Latter-day Saints throughout the world are modern pioneers in their own homelands, where they live with faith and courage in a time fraught with new challenges and opportunities. There are pages of history yet to be written. We each have an opportunity to leave a heritage for generations to follow that will help them understand the joy of living and sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ.As we learn more about the faith of those who have gone before us, we can better understand those with whom we have joined hands in bearing witness of the Savior and helping to establish his kingdom.

What she knows of life comes from her mother, who has survived abandonment by her husband in a land that treats her as if she were invisible, even though she and her children pick the crops of the farms that feed its people. But within Estrella, seeds of growth and change are stirring. And in the arms of Alejo, they burst into a full, fierce flower as she tastes the joy and pain of first love. Pushed to the margins of society, she learns to fight back and is able to help the young farmworker she loves when his ambitions and very life are threatened in a harvest of death. Infused with the beauty of the California landscape and shifting splendors of the passing seasons juxtaposed with the bleakness of poverty, this vividly imagined novel is worthy of the people it celebrates and whose story it tells so magnificently.

Who wouldn't be intrigued by what she had to say about Charles Boyer, Marlene Dietrich, Mickey Rooney―and Mae West? Her comments are only covered articles and screenplays by one of the twentieth century's major writers.Fascinated by ""the marvel of this age, cinema,"" Colette began writing for and about the movies in 1914. She was an innovative critic, among the first to recognize the artistic and educational potential of film, as well as the achievements of Abel Gance, Thomas Ince, Max reinhardt and Cecil B. DeMille.In 1917 Colette launched a column in Le Film, a pioneer journal of serious movie criticism. That same year she wrote the scenario for the Italian version of her novel La Vagabonde. For Colette it was a bitter experience, reflected in the hilariously incisive ""A Short Manual for the Aspiring Scenario Writer"" and ""Backstage at the Studio,"" both included here.Colette's contribution to film criticism was long overlooked because, out of literary snobbery, she eliminated her writings on the movies from the 1948 edition of her complete works. Now, Thanks to Alain and Odette Virmaux, two french film historians, this material is once again available and set in an overall context.Colette at the Movies includes scripts that Colette wrote for Marc Allegret's lac-Aux-Dames(1934) and Max Ophüls Divine(1935), which was drawn from her own L'envers du Music-Hall.

Alături de Raymond Aron, Voegelin a demistificat religiile politice moderne, calificându-le drept încercări de a imanentiza eshatonul, deci de a şterge distincţia dintre ceea ce ţine de regatul imanent şi ceea ce defineşte imperiul transcendent. Oricine vrea să înţeleagă gramatica ezoterică a comunismului şi pe cea a fascismului şi substratul lor gnostic trebuie să citească lucrările lui Voegelin.“ (Vladimir TISMĂNEANU)„Există epoci care interpelează stabilitatea conceptelor filozofice şi filozofi care depăşesc percepţia comună despre istorie şi timp. Eric Voegelin face parte din ultima categorie de gânditori, profund marcaţi de hecatombele secolului XX.

Pentru a neutraliza patologiile utopiei totalitare, e nevoie ca simţul etic al indignării şi precizia analizei conceptuale să întâlnească o sensibilitate teologică.

Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology,Max Weber,4.12,"1,484 rating","January 1, 1922","Max Weber's Economy and Society is the greatest sociological treatise written in this century. Published posthumously in Germany in the early 1920's, it has become a constitutive part of the modern sociological imagination. Economy and Society was the first strictly empirical comparison of social structures and normative orders in world-historical depth, containing the famous chapters on social action, religion, law, bureaucracy, charisma, the city, and the political community with its dimensions of class, status and power.Economy and Status is Weber's only major treatise for an educated general public. It was meant to be a broad introduction, but in its own way it is the most demanding textbook yet written by a sociologist. The precision of its definitions, the complexity of its typologies and the wealth of its historical content make the work a continuos challenge at several levels of comprehension: for the advanced undergraduate who gropes for his sense of society, for the graduate student who must develop his own analytical skills, and for the scholar who must match wits with Weber.When the long-awaited first complete English edition of Economy and Society was published in 1968, Arthur Stinchcombe wrote in the American Journal of Sociology: ""My answer to the question of whether people should still start their sociological intellectual biographies with Economy and Society is yes."" Reinhard Bendix noted in the American Sociological Review that the ""publication of a compete English edition of Weber's most systematic work [represents] the culmination of a cultural transmission to the American setting...It will be a study-guide and compendium for years to come for all those interested in historical sociology and comparative study.""In a lengthy introduction, Guenther Roth traces the intellectual prehistory of Economy and Society, the gradual emergence of its dominant themes and the nature of its internal logic.Mr. Roth is a Professor of Sociology at Columbia University.

Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior,Chögyam Trungpa,4.13,"6,988 rating","January 1, 1984","In this practical guide to enlightened living, Chögyam Trungpa offers an inspiring vision for our time, based on the figure of the sacred warrior. In ancient times, the warrior learned to master the challenges of life, both on and off the battlefield. He acquired a sense of personal freedom and power—not through violence or aggression, but through gentleness, courage, and self-knowledge. The Japanese samurai, the warrior-kings of Tibet, the knights of medieval Europe, and the warriors of the Native American tribes are a few examples of this universal tradition of wisdom. With this book the warrior's path is opened to contemporary men and women in search of self-mastery and greater fulfillment. Interpreting the warrior's journey in modern terms, Trungpa discusses such skills as synchronizing mind and body, overcoming habitual behaviors, relaxing within discipline, facing the world with openness and fearlessness, and finding the sacred dimension of everyday life. Above all, Trungpa shows that in discovering the basic goodness or human life, the warrior learns to radiate that goodness out into the world for the peace and sanity of others. The Shambhala teachings—named for a legendary Himalayan kingdom where prosperity and happiness reign—thus point to the potential for enlightened conduct that exists within every human being. ""The basic wisdom of Shambhala,"" Trungpa writes, ""is that in this world, as it is, we can find a good and meaningful human life that will also serve others. That is our true richness.""",256,183,752 follower,"['Buddhism', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Buddhism', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Buddhism', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Self Help', 'Psychology']",326 review,"3,239 (46%)","2,142 (30%)","1,096 (15%)",326 (4%),185 (2%)

Gribiche,Colette,4.00,10 rating,"January 1, 1937","Avec Gribiche, écrit en 1937, Colette explore une nouvelle fois l'«envers du music-hall» à la Belle Époque et se souvient de ces années folles où, jeune faune, à peine vêtue, elle attirait le Tout-Paris au Moulin-Rouge ou au Théâtre des Mathurins. Mais ce n'est pas de chronique mondaine qu'il s'agit dans Gribiche, bien au contraire. L'écrivain désormais consacré y rend hommage à la jeunesse éphémère et le plus souvent sacrifiée, à la beauté multiple et pathétique de ces artistes anonymes dont l'existence se consume en quelques saisons dans l'atmosphère vertigineuse et surchauffée des coulisses. Tandis que le public se grise de sons, de mouvements et de lumières, l'envers du décor peut dissimuler d'authentiques tragédies.L'histoire de Gribiche en est une. Rien ne manque au rituel : ni la promesse du bonheur, ni la malice du destin, ni le sang du sacrifice.","PaperbackFirst published January 1, 1937",555,"1,498 follower",[],2 review,2 (20%),6 (60%),2 (20%),0 (0%),0 (0%)

Revolution in Science,I. Bernard Cohen,4.13,32 rating,"March 15, 1987","Only a scholar as rich in learning as I. Bernard Cohen could do justice to a theme so subtle and yet so grand. Spanning five centuries and virtually all of scientific endeavor, ""Revolution in Science"" traces the nuances that differentiate both scientific revolutions and human perceptions of them, weaving threads of detail from physics, mathematics, behaviorism, Freud, atomic physics, and even plate tectonics and molecular biology, into the larger fabric of intellectual history.How did ""revolution,"" a term from the physical sciences, meaning a turning again and implying permanence and recurrence--the cyclical succession of the seasons, the 'revolutions' of the planets in their orbits--become transformed into an expression for radical change in political and socioeconomic affairs, then become appropriated once again to the sciences?How have political revolutions--French, American, Bolshevik--and such intellectual forces as Darwinism further modified the concept, from revolution in science as a dramatic break with the past to the idea that science progresses by the slow accumulation of knowledge? And what does each transformation in each historical period tell us about the deep conceptual changes in our image of the scientist and scientific activity?Cohen's exploration seeks to uncover nothing less than the nature of all scientific revolutions, the stages by which they occur, their time scale, specific criteria for determining whether or not there has been a revolution, and the creative factors in producing a revolutionary new idea. His book is a probing analysis of the history of an idea and one of the most impressive surveys of the history of science ever undertaken.",734,82,8 follower,"['Science', 'History', 'History Of Science', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction']",6 review,9 (28%),19 (59%),3 (9%),1 (3%),0 (0%)

In company with cultures of many different times and places, we name these things as air, fire, water, and earth.Whether we see them as the breath, energy, blood, and body of the Mother, or as the blessed gifts of a Creator, or as symbols of the interconnected systems that sustain life, we know that nothing can live without them.To call these things sacred is to say that they have a value beyond their usefulness for human ends, that they themselves became the standards by which our acts, our economics, our laws, and our purposes must be judged. no one has the right to appropriate them or profit from them at the expense of others. Any government that fails to protect them forfeits its legitimacy.All people, all living things, are part of the earth life, and so are sacred. No one of us stands higher or lower than any other. Only justice can assure only ecological balance can sustain freedom. Only in freedom can that fifth sacred thing we call spirit flourish in its full diversity.To honor the sacred is to create conditions in which nourishment, sustenance, habitat, knowledge, freedom, and beauty can thrive. To honor the sacred is to make love possible.To this we dedicate our curiosity, our will, our courage, our silences, and our voices. To this we dedicate our lives.Praise for The Fifth Sacred Thing“This is wisdom wrapped in drama.” —Tom Hayden, California state senator“Starhawk makes the jump to fiction quite smoothly with this memorable first novel.” — Locus“Totally captivating . . . a vision of the paradigm shift that is essential for our very survival as a species on this planet.” —Elinor Gadon, author of The Once and Future Goddess“This strong debut fits well against feminist futuristic, utopic, and dystopic works by the likes of Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Ursula LeGuin, and Margaret Atwood.” — Library Journal",486,48,927 follower,"['Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Spirituality', 'Dystopia', 'Feminism', 'Speculative Fiction']",619 review,"3,832 (51%)","2,116 (28%)",917 (12%),329 (4%),232 (3%)

CAGNEY,John McCabe,4.03,148 rating,"January 1, 1997","Cagney came from a poor Irish-American New York family but once he found his metier as an actor, it was not long before he was recognized as a brilliantly energetic and powerful phenomenon. After the tremendous impact of Public Enemy - in which he notoriously pushed half a grapefruit into Mae Clarke's face - he was typecast as a gangster because of the terrifying violence that seemed to be pent up within him. Years of pitched battle with Warner Brothers finally liberated him from those roles, and he went on to star in such triumphs as the musicals Yankee Doodle Dandy (winning the 1942 Oscar for best actor) and Love Me or Leave Me. Even so, one of his greatest later roles involved a return to crime - as the psychopathic killer in the terrifying White Heat. He retired from films in 1961 after making Billy Wilder's One, Two, Three, only to return twenty years later for Ragtime. But however much Cagney personified violence and explosive energy on the screen, in life he was a quiet, introspective, and deeply private man, a poet, painter, and environmentalist, whose marriage to his early vaudeville partner was famously loyal and happy. His story is one of the few Hollywood biographies that reflect a fulfilled life as well as a spectacular career.",439,101,18 follower,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Film']",20 review,52 (35%),54 (36%),37 (25%),4 (2%),1 (<1%)
