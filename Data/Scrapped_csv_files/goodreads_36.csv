The World Set Free,H.G. Wells,3.46,"1,610 rating","January 1, 1914","This chilling, futuristic novel, written in 1913 and first published the following year, was incredibly prophetic on a major scale. Wells was a genius and visionary, as demonstrated by many of his other works, but this book is clearly one of his best. He predicts nuclear warfare years before research began and describes the chain reactions involved and the resulting radiation. He describes a weapon of enormous destructive power, used from the air that would wipe out everything for miles, and actually used the term ""atomic bombs."" This book may have been at least part of the original inspiration for the development of atomic weapons, as well as presenting many other ideas that would ultimately come to pass. Some ideas may still be coming, including a one-world government referred to as The World Republic, that will attempt to end all wars.",140,"5,958","9,939 follower","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Literature', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Novels']",200 review,299 (18%),484 (30%),546 (33%),215 (13%),66 (4%)
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,Harold Abelson,4.47,"4,668 rating","January 1, 1984","Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula over the past decade. This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises.

El astillero,Juan Carlos Onetti,3.79,"1,974 rating","January 1, 1961","En El astillero alcanzan su madurez, el resplandor más compacto de la derrota, dos invenciones notables de Onetti: el fugaz antihéroe Larsen y la imperecedera, pero nunca nueva, ciudad de Santa María; esa ciudad portuaria que lo mismo podría ser el fantasma de Montevideo o de Buenos Aires, que está cerca de la ciudad argentina de rosario pero no pertenece a país alguno. Otra vez, frente a este proxeneta con rasgos místicos -Larsen-, canalla con tanto de hundido como de salvado; frente a esta ciudad inexistente en la realidad pero verdadera, de ficción pero no de juguete, podemos caer en la tentación de felicitar a Onetti por presentar un pedazo descarnado de latinoamérica, sin exotismo ni prodigios, sin utilizar la impotencia y la erosión para exportar como un folclore alegre y vendible. Pero cualquier habitante de Europa del Este, de los años 30 o de los posteriores a la segunda guerra, podría encontrar en esta ciudad catastrófica tantos factores en común como un latinoamericano o un norteamericano de una desolada ciudad del sur. La ambición de Larsen por conquistar a una débil mental -o loca- recuerda la novela serial de Isaac B. Singer, Shosha, ambientada a fines de los 30 en Polonia, y en juntacadáveres Larsen tiene más de un punto de contacto con el proxeneta polaco Max que protagoniza la novela de Singer Escoria.

Must a Jew Believe Anything?,Menachem Marc Kellner,3.84,49 rating,"February 1, 1999","The crucial question for today's Jewish world, Menachem Kellner argues, is not whether Jews will have Jewish grandchildren, but how many different sorts of mutually exclusive Judaisms those grandchildren will face. Kellner's short, brisk, and accessible book examines how the split that threatens the Jewish future can be avoided. The first six chapters of this strongly argued book analyse what religious faith means in classical Judaism and will be of interest to anyone seeking lucid insights into the nature of Judaism. The final chapter builds upon the conclusions of the first six in order to argue for a new way of construing the relationship of Orthodoxy to non-Orthodox Jews and institutions. Kellner argues that the Orthodox practice of framing the debate with non-Orthodox movements in terms of dogmatic fidelity contrasted with heresy is not the traditional Jewish approach, and that the debate could well be framed in other ways, ways that would allow all Jews to work together towards a less polarized Jewish future. Undoubtedly, Must a Jew Believe Anything? has the potential to make a difference to how Orthodoxy understands itself and its relationship to other Jewish movements in the modern world.

Tvrđava,Meša Selimović,4.67,"5,367 rating","January 1, 1970","Dve osnove odlike Selimovićevog rukopisa određuju ovaj roman: gradnja zanimljive fabule i majstorsko oblikovanje likova. Možda pre svega, smisao i besmisao kao osnovna uporišta čovekovog identiteta; večita i sveprisutna pitanja koja proganjaju pisca i njegove junake u vremenima društvene prisile kada bujaju strah i nesigurnost i kada se ljudi povlače u sebe ili napadaju bližnje.

First published in 1979 by Avon books, this World War II novel, with overtones of From Here to Eternity, was a precursor to the gay romance genre. Jack Hardigan's Hellcat fighter squadron blew the Japanese Zekes out of the blazing Pacific skies. But a more subtle kind of hell was brewing in his feelings for rookie pilot Fred Trusteau. While a beautiful widow pursues Jack, and another pilot becomes suspicious of Jack and Fred's close friendship, the two heroes cut a fiery swath through the skies from Wake Island to Tarawa to Truk, there to keep a fateful rendezvous with love and death in the blood-clouded waters of the Pacific.

Ex Ponto,Ivo Andrić,4.31,855 rating,"January 1, 1918","Ex Ponto je knjiga stihova u prozi koju je napisao Ivo Andrić 1918. godine.

Liebelei / Reigen,Arthur Schnitzler,3.64,309 rating,"January 1, 1989","""Girotondo"", opera teatrale di Schnitzler di cui nel 1904 venne vietata la pubblicazione perché giudicata oscena, è un dramma in cui dieci individui di differente estrazione sociale (dal conte alla prostituta, passando per il poeta e la ragazzina) si incontrano a due a due in altrettante scene. I quadri consistono quindi dei loro dialoghi e si concludono sempre con un atto sessuale, che non viene però mai rappresentato sul palco. Uno dei due personaggi della scena appena conclusa riappare in quella successiva, in una concatenazione di incontri che potrebbe procedere all'infinito. Quello di Schnitzler è un testo grottesco, in cui i personaggi e le loro parole si svuotano di senso, in cui la danza del corteggiamento si conclude in rapporti sessuali aridi e scontati. A dominare e governare i comportamenti umani è la banalità, la vacuità delle relazioni, l'assenza di sentimenti sinceri.

Gig: Americans Talk About Their Jobs,John Bowe,4.12,"1,394 rating","January 1, 2000","More than 150 people in common and unusual occupations talk about their lives and work in the new economy, encompassing the human experience from a labor-support doula to a funeral home director.For the last several years, the editors of Word, the pioneering Web magazine, have been sending interviewers—nearly forty in all—across America to talk to people about their jobs. They wanted to document reality, not to advance any overarching thesis or political agenda. Their sole position on work was that it's a fascinating topic and an elemental part of nearly everyone's life. They were certainly not disappointed with what they found; this wide-ranging survey of the American economy at the turn of the millennium is stunning, surprising, and always entertaining. It gives us an unflinching view of the fabric of this country from the point of view of the people who keep it all moving.Recalling Studs Terkel's 1972 classic best-seller, Working, the more than 120 roughly textured monologues that make up Gig beautifully capture the voices of our fast-paced and diverse economy. The selections demonstrate how much our world has changed—and stayed the same—in the last three decades. If you think things have speeded up, become more complicated and more technological, you're right.But people's attitudes about their jobs, their hopes and goals and disappointments, endure. Gig's soul isn't sociological—it's emotional. The wholehearted diligence that people bring to their work is deeply, inexplicably moving. People speak in these pages of the constant and complex stresses nearly all of them confront on the job, but, nearly universally, they throw themselves without reservation into coping with them. Instead of resisting work, we seem to adapt to it. Some of us love our jobs, some of us don't, but almost all of us are not quite sure what we would do without one.With all the hallmarks of another classic on this subject, Gig is a fabulous read, filled with indelible voices from coast to coast. After hearing them, you'll never again feel quite the same about how we work.",688,16,19 follower,"['Nonfiction', 'Sociology', 'Business', 'Biography', 'Essays', 'Economics', 'Labor', 'Nonfiction', 'Sociology', 'Business', 'Biography', 'Essays', 'Economics', 'Labor', 'Nonfiction', 'Sociology', 'Business', 'Biography', 'Essays', 'Economics', 'Labor', 'Nonfiction', 'Sociology', 'Business', 'Biography', 'Essays', 'Economics', 'Labor', 'Nonfiction', 'Sociology', 'Business', 'Biography', 'Essays', 'Economics', 'Labor']",159 review,553 (39%),522 (37%),267 (19%),44 (3%),8 (<1%)

The Moon Is Down,John Steinbeck,3.93,"28,270 rating","January 1, 1942","Taken by surprise, a small coastal town is overrun by an invading army with little resistance. The town is important because it is a port that serves a large coal mine. Colonel Lanser, the head of the invading battalion, along with his staff establishes his HQ in the house of the democratically elected and popular Mayor Orden.As the reality of occupation sinks in and the weather turns bleak, with the snows beginning earlier than usual, the ""simple, peaceful people"" of the town are angry and confused. Colonel Lanser, a veteran of many wars, tries to operate under a veil of civility and law, but in his heart he knows that ""there are no peaceful people"" amongst those whose freedom has been taken away by force. The veil is soon torn apart when Alexander Morden, an erstwhile alderman and ""a free man,"" is ordered to work in the mine. He strikes out at Captain Loft with a pick axe, but Captain Bentick steps into its path and dies of it. After a summary trial, Morden is executed by a firing squad. This incident catalyzes the people of the town and they settle into ""a slow, silent, waiting revenge."" Sections of the railroad linking the port with the mine get damaged regularly, the machinery breaks down often, and the dynamo of the electricity generators gets short circuited. Whenever a soldier relaxes his guard, drinks or goes out with a woman, he is killed. Mayor Orden stands by his people, and tries to explain to Col. Lanser that his goal – ""to break man’s spirit permanently"" – is impossible.The cold weather and the constant fear weighs heavy on the occupying force, many of whom wish the war to end so that they can return home. They realize the futility of the war and that ""the flies have conquered the flypaper."" Some members of the resistance escape to England and ask the English for explosives so that the townspeople can intensify their efforts. English planes parachute-drop small packages containing dynamite sticks and chocolates all around the town. In a state of panic, the army takes the Mayor and his friend Dr. Winter, the town doctor and historian, hostage and lets it be known that any action from resistance will lead to their execution. Mayor Orden knows that nothing can stop his people and that his death is imminent. He tells his wife that while he can be killed, the idea of Mayor (and freedom and democracy) is beyond the reach of any army. Before his execution, Mayor Orden reminds Dr. Winter of the dialogues of Socrates in the Apology, a part he played in the high school play, and tells him to make sure that the debt is repaid to the army, i.e., that the resistance is continued.",144,784,22.5k follower,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'War', 'Literature', 'American', 'Novels']","2,350 review","8,107 (28%)","11,915 (42%)","6,666 (23%)","1,273 (4%)",309 (1%)

"Please Understand Me II: Temperament, Character, Intelligence",David Keirsey,4.17,"6,484 rating","May 1, 1998","Phenomenon: Keirsey and Bates's Please Understand Me, first published in 1978, sold nearly 2 million copies in its first 20 years, becoming a perennial best seller all over the world. Advertised only by word of mouth, the book became a favorite training and counseling guide in many institutions -- government, church, business -- and colleges across the nation adopted it as an auxiliary text in a dozen different departments. Why? Perhaps it was the user-friendly way that Please Understand Me helped people find their personality style. Perhaps it was the simple accuracy of Keirsey's portraits of temperament and character types. Or perhaps it was the book's essential message: that members of families and institutions are OK, even though they are fundamentally different from each other, and that they would all do well to appreciate their differences and give up trying to change others into copies of themselves.Now: Please Understand Me IIFor the past twenty years Keirsey has continued to investigate personality differences -- to refine his theory of the four temperaments and to define the facets of character that distinguish one from another. His findings form the basis of Please Understand Me II, an updated and greatly expanded edition of the book, far more comprehensive and coherent than the original, and yet with much of the same easy accessibility. One major addition is Keirsey's view of how the temperaments differ in the intelligent roles they are most likely to develop. Each of us, he says, has four kinds of intelligence -- tactical, logistical, diplomatic, strategic -- though one of the four interests us far more than the others, and thus gets far more practice than the rest. Like four suits in a hand of cards, we each have a long suit and a short suit in what interests us and what we do well, and fortunate indeed are those whose work matches their skills. As in the original book, Please Understand Me II begins with The Keirsey Temperament Sorter, the most used personality inventory in the world. But also included is The Keirsey Four-Types Sorter, a new short questionnaire that identifies one's basic temperament and then ranks one's second, third, and fourth choices.

In the Shape of a Boar,Lawrence Norfolk,3.46,268 rating,"January 1, 2000","Lawrence Norfolk's In the Shape of a Boar is a juggernaut of a novel, an epic tour de force of love and betrayal, ancient myths and modern horrors. The story begins in the ancient world of mythic Greece, where a dark tale of treachery and destructive love unfolds amid the hunt for the Boar of Kalydon -- a tale that will reverberate in those same hills across the millennia in the final chaotic months of World War II, as a band of Greek partisans pursues an S.S. officer on a mission of vengeance. After the war, a young Jewish Romanian refugee, Solomon Memel, who was among the hunters will create a poem based on the experience, which becomes an international literary sensation. But the truth of what happened in the hills of Kalydon in 1945 is more complicated than it seems, and as the older Sol reunites with his childhood love in 1970s Paris, the dark memories and horrors of those days will emerge anew.

The Divided Self: An Existential Study in Sanity and Madness,R.D. Laing,4.11,"5,823 rating","January 1, 1960","In The Divided Self (1960), Laing contrasted the experience of the ""ontologically secure"" person with that of a person who ""cannot take the realness, aliveness, autonomy and identity of himself and others for granted"" and who consequently contrives strategies to avoid ""losing his self"". Laing explains how we all exist in the world as beings, defined by others who carry a model of us in their heads, just as we carry models of them in our heads. In later writings he often takes this to deeper levels, laboriously spelling out how ""A knows that B knows that A knows that B knows...""! Our feelings and motivations derive very much from this condition of ""being in the world"" in the sense of existing for others, who exist for us. Without this we suffer ""ontological insecurity"", a condition often expressed in terms of ""being dead"" by people who are clearly still physically alive.This watershed work aimed to make madness comprehensible, and in doing so revolutionized the way we perceive mental illness. Using case studies of patients he had worked with, psychiatrist R. D. Laing argued that psychosis is not a medical condition, but an outcome of the 'divided self', or the tension between the two personas within us: one our authentic, private identity, and the other the false, 'sane' self that we present to the world. Laing's radical approach to insanity offered a rich existential analysis of personal alienation and made him a cult figure in the 1960s, yet his work was most significant for its humane attitude, which put the patient back at the centre of treatment. R.D. Laing (1927-1989), one of the best-known psychiatrists of modern times, was born in Glasgow, Scotland.This work is available on its own or as part of the 7 volume set iSelected Works of R. D.

At the Almayer Inn, a remote shoreline hotel, an artist dips his brush in a cup of ocean water to paint a portrait of the sea. A scientist pens love letters to a woman he has yet to meet. An adulteress searches for relief from her proclivity to fall in love. And a sixteen-year-old girl seeks a cure from a mysterious condition which science has failed to remedy. When these people meet, their fates begin to interact as if by design.

When the author was born in Tierra del Fuego in 1874, it was truly an unknown land. On the southern coast was the small settlement established by his missionary parents; the rest of it, over 18,000 square miles of mountain, forest, marsh, and lake, was the hunting ground of fierce and hostile tribes. Bridges grew up among the coastal Yaghans, learning their language and their ways. In young manhood he made contact with the wild inland Ona tribe, became their friend and hunting companion, and was initiated into the men's lodge.

New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,Anonymous,4.51,"1,360 rating","January 1, 1961","It is a very responsible thing to translate the Holy Scriptures from their original languages of Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek into modern speech. Translating the Holy Scriptures means rendering into another language the thoughts and sayings of Jehovah God, the heavenly Author of this sacred library of sixty-six books that holy men of long ago were inspired to write down for our benefit today.That is a very sobering thought. The translators of this work, who fear and love the Divine Author of the Holy Scriptures, feel toward Him a special responsibility to transmit his thoughts and declarations as accurately as possible. They also feel a responsibility toward the searching readers who depend upon a translation of the inspired Word of the Most High God for their everlasting salvation.It was with such a sense of solemn responsibility that over the course of many years this committee of dedicated men have produced the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. The entire work was originally released in six volumes, from 1950 to 1960. From the start it was the desire of the translators to have all these volumes brought together into one book, inasmuch as the Holy Scriptures are in actuality one book by the One Author. While the original volumes contained marginal references and footnotes, the revised one-volume edition, released in 1961, contained neither footnotes nor marginal references. A second revision was released in 1970 and a third revision with footnotes followed in 1971. In 1969 the committee released The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures, which presented under the Greek text revised by Westcott and Hort (1948 Reprint) a literal word-for-word translation into English. During the past 34 years the New World Translation has been translated in part or in its entirety into ten other languages, with a total printing and distribution surpassing 39 million.This new edition is not just a refinement of the translated text beyond its already previous revisions, but it has been expanded to include a complete updating and revision of the marginal (cross) references that were initially presented in English, from 1950 to 1960.This 1984 revision has been released by us to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania for printing, translation into other leading languages and distribution. We thus make it available with a deep sense of gratitude to the Divine Author of the Holy Scriptures, who has so privileged us and in whose spirit we have trusted in producing this revision. We pray for his blessing upon those who use this translation for spiritual advancement.New World Bible Translation CommitteeJune 1, 1984, New York, N.Y.",1600,791k,"3,149 follower","['Religion', 'Reference', 'Classics', 'Spirituality', 'Theology', 'Christianity', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Reference', 'Classics', 'Spirituality', 'Theology', 'Christianity', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Reference', 'Classics', 'Spirituality', 'Theology', 'Christianity', 'Nonfiction']",140 review,"1,121 (82%)",49 (3%),52 (3%),44 (3%),94 (6%)

Here transvestites who might play at being Nazis and beautiful she-males enact the rituals of courtly love.

Under the Black  Ensign,L. Ron Hubbard,3.43,348 rating,"January 1, 1935","Long before Captain Jack Sparrow raised hell with the Pirates of the Caribbean, Tom Bristol sailed to hell and back Under the Black Ensign. That’s where the real adventure begins. Bristol’s had plenty of bad luck in his life. Press-ganged into serving aboard a British vessel, he’s felt the cruel captain’s lash on his back. Then, freed from his servitude by pirates, his good fortune immediately takes a bad turn … the buccaneers accuse him of murder and leave him to die on a deserted island. Now all he has left are a few drops of water, a gun and just enough bullets to put himself out of his misery. But Bristol’s luck is about to change. Finding himself in the unexpected company of a fiery woman, he rescues a slave ship, unsheathes his sword, raises a pirate flag of his own and sets off to make love and war on the open seas in this nautical adventure. In his early twenties, Hubbard led the two-and-a-half-month, five-thousand-mile Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition. He followed that with the West Indies Mineralogical Expedition near San Juan, Puerto Rico, in which he completed the island’s first mineralogical survey as an American territory. It was during these two journeys that Hubbard became an expert on the Caribbean’s colorful history—an expertise he drew on to write stories like Under the Black Ensign. “A riveting tale of sailing ships, piracy and the high seas.” —Midwest Book Review * A National Indie Excellence Award Winner",121,"1,663",523 follower,"['Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Historical Fiction', 'Pirates', 'Pulp', 'Action', 'Historical']",128 review,71 (20%),97 (27%),107 (30%),55 (15%),18 (5%)

The Unsettling of America: Culture and Agriculture,Wendell Berry,4.34,"5,649 rating","January 1, 1977","Since its publication by Sierra Club Books in 1977, The Unsettling of America has been recognized as a classic of American letters. In it, Wendell Berry argues that good farming is a cultural development and spiritual discipline. Today’s agribusiness, however, takes farming out of its cultural context and away from families. As a result, we as a nation are more estranged from the land—from the intimate knowledge, love, and care of it. Sadly, as Berry notes in his Afterword to this third edition, his arguments and observations are more relevant than ever. We continue to suffer loss of community, the devaluation of human work, and the destruction of nature under an economic system dedicated to the mechanistic pursuit of products and profits. Although “this book has not had the happy fate of being proved wrong,” Berry writes, there are good people working “to make something comely and enduring of our life on this earth.” Wendell Berry is one of those people, writing and working, as ever, with passion, eloquence, and conviction.",246,319,"4,054 follower","['Nonfiction', 'Food', 'Agriculture', 'Nature', 'History', 'Environment', 'Essays']",596 review,"3,021 (53%)","1,809 (32%)",616 (10%),150 (2%),53 (<1%)
