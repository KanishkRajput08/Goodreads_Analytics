The Scapegoat,René Girard,4.15,817 rating,"January 1, 1982","Widely regarded as one of the most profound critics of our time, René Girard has pursued a powerful line of inquiry across the fields of the humanities and the social sciences. His theories, which the French press has termed ""l'hypothèse girardienne,"" have sparked interdisciplinary, even international, controversy. In The Scapegoat, Girard applies his approach to ""texts of persecution,"" documents that recount phenomena of collective violence from the standpoint of the persecutor--documents such as the medieval poet Guillaume de Machaut's Judgement of the King of Navarre, which blames the Jews for the Black Death and describes their mass murder.Girard compares persecution texts with myths, most notably with the myth of Oedipus, and finds strikingly similar themes and structures. Could myths regularly conceal texts of persecution? Girard's answers lies in a study of the Christian Passion, which represents the same central event, the same collective violence, found in all mythology, but which is read from the point of view of the innocent victim. The Passion text provides the model interpretation that has enabled Western culture to demystify its own violence--a demystification Girard now extends to mythology.Underlying Girard's daring textual hypothesis is a powerful theory of history and culture. Christ's rejection of all guilt breaks the mythic cycle of violence and the sacred. The scapegoat becomes the Lamb of God; ""the foolish genesis of blood-stained idols and the false gods of superstition, politics, and ideologies"" are revealed.",216,120,636 follower,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Anthropology', 'Theology', 'Sociology', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Anthropology', 'Theology', 'Sociology', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Anthropology', 'Theology', 'Sociology', 'Psychology']",72 review,353 (43%),295 (36%),120 (14%),37 (4%),12 (1%)

"The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914",David McCullough,4.21,"20,337 rating","June 1, 1977","On December 31, 1999, after nearly a century of rule, the United States officially ceded ownership of the Panama Canal to the nation of Panama. That nation did not exist when, in the mid-19th century, Europeans first began to explore the possibilities of creating a link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the narrow but mountainous isthmus; Panama was then a remote and overlooked part of Colombia.All that changed, writes David McCullough in his magisterial history of the Canal, in 1848, when prospectors struck gold in California. A wave of fortune seekers descended on Panama from Europe and the eastern United States, seeking quick passage on California-bound ships in the Pacific, and the Panama Railroad, built to serve that traffic, was soon the highest-priced stock listed on the New York Exchange. To build a 51-mile-long ship canal to replace that railroad seemed an easy matter to some investors. But, as McCullough notes, the construction project came to involve the efforts of thousands of workers from many nations over four decades; eventually those workers, laboring in oppressive heat in a vast malarial swamp, removed enough soil and rock to build a pyramid a mile high. In the early years, they toiled under the direction of French entrepreneur Ferdinand de Lesseps, who went bankrupt while pursuing his dream of extending France's empire in the Americas. The United States then entered the picture, with President Theodore Roosevelt orchestrating the purchase of the canal—but not before helping foment a revolution that removed Panama from Colombian rule and placed it squarely in the American camp.",698,99,10k follower,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Historical', 'World History', 'Audiobook', 'Travel']","1,839 review","8,937 (43%)","7,694 (37%)","3,025 (14%)",501 (2%),180 (<1%)

London is in shock. The very look of daily life is a walking nightmare of German uniforms, artifacts, regulations. There are collaborators. There are profiteers. But there are others working in hope, in secret, and desperate danger, against the invader. And still others are living strangely ambiguous lives – none more so than Detective Superintendent Douglas Archer (""Archer of the yard"" as the press like to call him), trying to maintain a peculiarly, almost sacredly, British institution under a Nazi chief. Archer has started work on what seems, at first, a routine murder case. But suddenly an SS Standartenführer from Himmler's personal staff flies in from Berlin to supervise the investigation, and Archer is plunged deep into an espionage battle for which he is completely unprepared, and where the stakes are incredibly high. ""We’re dealing with something that could prove so deadly that not even the Black Death would compare with the consequences"", the SS man tells him.Setting forth on a tight rope trail of violence, betrayal and danger, Archer moves into worlds within worlds of intrigue.

She was a leading innovator in theorizing object relations theory. Klein had a major influence on the theory and technique of psychoanalysis, particularly in Great Britain. As a divorced woman whose academic qualifications did not even include a bachelor's degree, Klein was a visible iconoclast within a profession dominated by male physicians. After the arrival of Sigmund Freud and his psychoanalyst daughter, Anna Freud, in London in 1938, Klein’s ideas came into conflict with those of Continental analysts who were migrating to Britain. Following protracted debates between the followers of Klein and the followers of Anna Freud during the 1940s (the so-called 'controversial discussions'), the British Psychoanalytical Society split into three separate training divisions: (1) Kleinian, (2) Anna Freudian, and (3) independent. This division remains to the current time. Kleinian psychoanalysis remains a large and influential school of psychoanalysis within Britain, in much of Latin America, and to an extent in continental Europe. Melanie Klein's works are collected in four volumes, of which this is volume One. A timeless book: the pioneering and fascinating work of Melanie Klein who shaped child psychoanalysis.

A Song of Ice and Fire,George R.R. Martin,4.60,"60,120 rating","January 1, 2000","For the first time, all five novels in the epic fantasy series that inspired HBO's ""Game of Thrones ""are together in one boxed set. An immersive entertainment experience unlike any other, A Song of Ice and Fire has earned George R. R. Martin--dubbed ""the American Tolkien"" by ""Time"" magazine--international acclaim and millions of loyal readers. Now here is the entire monumental cycle: A GAME OF THRONESA CLASH OF KINGSA STORM OF SWORDSA FEAST OF CROWSA DANCE WITH DRAGONS Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King's Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert's name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse--unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season.  Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen's brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister--the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms.  Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki--whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.""",5216,"1,414",110k follower,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Dragons']","1,813 review","42,520 (70%)","13,040 (21%)","3,245 (5%)",770 (1%),545 (<1%)

"The Hunger, and Other Stories",Charles Beaumont,4.00,267 rating,"April 1, 1957","When The Hunger and Other Stories (1957) appeared, it heralded the arrival of Charles Beaumont (1929-1967) as an important and highly original new voice in American fiction. Although he is best known today for his scripts for television and film, including several classic episodes of The Twilight Zone, Beaumont is being rediscovered as a master of weird tales, and this, his first published collection, contains some of his best. Ranging in tone from the chilling Gothic horror of ""Miss Gentilbelle,"" where an insane mother dresses her son up as a girl and slaughters his pets, to deliciously dark humor in tales like ""Open House"" and ""The Infernal Bouillabaisse,"" where murderers' plans go disastrously awry, these seventeen stories demonstrate Beaumont's remarkable talent and versatility. This new edition of The Hunger and Other Stories, the first in more than fifty years, includes a new introduction by Dr. Bernice M. Murphy, who argues for reevaluation of Beaumont alongside the other greats of the genre, including Shirley Jackson, Ray Bradbury, and Richard Matheson.Contents:Miss Gentilbelle • (1957) The Vanishing American • (1955)A Point of Honor • (1955) Fair Lady • (1957) Free Dirt • (1955) Open House • (1957)The Train • (1957) The Dark Music • (1956) The Customers • (1957)Last Night in the Rain • (1956)The Crooked Man • (1955) Nursery Rhyme • (1957) The Murderers • (1955) The Hunger • (1955) Tears of the Madonna • (1957) The Infernal Bouillabaisse • (1957)Black Country • (1954)","HardcoverFirst published April 1, 1957",187,142 follower,"['Horror', 'Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Weird Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics']",37 review,85 (31%),110 (41%),62 (23%),8 (2%),2 (<1%)

Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World,René Girard,4.27,686 rating,"January 1, 1978","An astonishing work of cultural criticism, this book is widely recognized as a brilliant and devastating challenge to conventional views of literature, anthropology, religion, and psychoanalysis. In its scope and itnerest it can be compared with Freud's Totem and Taboo, the subtext Girard refutes with polemic daring, vast erudition, and a persuasiveness that leaves the reader compelled to respond, one way or another.This is the single fullest summation of Girard's ideas to date, the book by which they will stand or fall. In a dialogue with two psychiatrists (Jean-Michel Oughourlian and Guy Lefort), Girard probes an encyclopedic array of topics, ranging across the entire spectrum of anthropology, psychoanalysis, and cultural production.Girard's point of departure is what he calles ""mimesis,"" the conflict that arises when human rivals compete to differentiate themselves from each other, yet succeed only in becoming more and more alike. At certain points in the life of a society, according to Girard, this mimetic conflict erupts into a crisis in which all difference dissolves in indiscriminate violence. In primitive societies, such crises were resolved by the ""scapegoating mechanism,"" in which the community, en masse, turned on an unpremeditated victim. The repression of this collective murder and its repetition in ritual sacrifice then formed the foundations of both religion and the restored social order.How does Christianity, at once the most ""sacrificial"" of religions and a faith with a non-violent ideology, fit into this scheme? Girard grants Freud's point, in Totem and Taboo, that Christianity is similar to primitive religion, but only to refute Freud—if Christ is sacrificed, Girard argues, it is not becuase God willed it, but because human beings wanted it.The book is not merely, or perhaps not mainly, biblical exegesis, for within its scope fall some of the most vexing problems of social history—the paradox that violence has social efficacy, the function of the scapegoat, the mechanism of anti-semitism.",470,120,636 follower,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Religion', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Religion', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Religion', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Religion', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Religion', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology']",94 review,364 (53%),201 (29%),79 (11%),27 (3%),15 (2%)

في ظلال القرآن,Sayed Qutb,4.53,"3,554 rating","January 1, 1971","خواطر وانطباعات من فترة عاشها سيد قطب في ظلال القرآن دوّنها في هذه المجلدات الستة منطلقاً في ذلك من حقيقة أبدية وهي أن القرآن حقيقة ذات كينونة مستمرة كهذا الكون ذاته، الكون كتاب الله المنظور، والقرآن كتاب الله المقروء، وكلاهما شاهد ودليل على صاحبه المبدع، كما أن كليهما كائن ليعمل. فالكون بنواحيه ما زال يتحرك ويؤدي دوره الذي قدره له بارئه والقرآن كذلك أدى دوره للبشرية، وما يزال هو هو، والإنسان ما يزال هو هو في حقيقته وفي أصل فطرته. وهذا القرآن هو خطاب الله لهذا الإنسان، فيمن خاطبهم الله به، خطاب لا يتغير فهو يخاطبه في أصل فطرته وفي أصل حقيقته، لذا كان لا بد من التمعن أكثر لإدراك المعاني التي رمت إليها سوره وآياته، ولإدراك ما فيه من الحيوية الكامنة لتلقي التوجيه المدخر منه للجماعة المسلمة في كل جيل، وذلك من خلال استحضار سيد قطب في تصوره كينونة الجماعة المسلمة الأولى التي خوطبت بهذا القرآن لأول مرة للعيش معها لتمثلها في بشريتها الحقيقية، وفي حياتها الواقعية، وفي مشكلاتها الإنسانية، وبتأمل قيادة القرآن لها قيادة مباشرة في شؤونها اليومية وفي أهدافها الكلية على السواء، ويرى كيف يأخذ القرآن بيدها خطوة خطوة، لينتقل بعدها إلى الجماعة الإسلامية اليوم المخاطبة بالقرآن في مثل ما خوطبت به الجماعة الأولى، فالبشرية بكل خصائصها المعروفة، تملك الاستجابة للقرآن، والانتفاع بقيادته في ذات الطريق.بهذه النظرة رأى سيد قطب بأن القرآن حياً يعمل في حياة المسلمة الأولى، ويملك أن يعمل في حياة المسلمين اليوم والقرآن هو اليوم معهم وكذلك غداً، وأنه ليس مجرد تراتيل تعبدية بعيدة عن واقع المسلمين المحدد، كما أنه ليس تاريخاً نص وانقضى وبطلت فاعليته وتفاعله مع الحياة البشرية. من هذا المنطلق يمضي سيد قطب في ظلال القرآن يستشف معانيه، يفسر آياته بأسلوب بعيد عن ساليب أئمة التفسير المتقدمين، ملتزماً بروح تفاسيرهم وبجوهرها، ليحاكي عقولاً اختلفت في منهجيتها وبطريقة تفكيرها وتنظيرها للأمور والوقائع عن عقول معاصري أئمة التفسير المتقدمين. حيث يورد السورة معرفاً بها وبعدد آياتها ومكية هي أم مدنية والراجح عنده. ثم يمضي في إيراد الآيات حيث يورد مجموعة من الآيات متتابعة تدور معانيها ضمن السياق نفسه فيأخذ في استشفاف مدلولاتها مجتمعة ليفسرها بعد ذلك آية آية مستنداً إلى المأثور في التفسير وهذا لم يمنعه من إيراد التفسير بلغة معاصرة تدور في معانيها خواطر إيمانية عميقة يعكس من خلالها سيد قطب التوجه التربوي القرآني الذي يأخذ بعين الاعتبار الإنسان بخلجاته وسكناته، بنفسيته وتألباتها ومتطلباتها وأهوائها، وبالمعطيات الآنية والمستقبلية التي تمتد امتداد حياة الإنسان على وجه الأرض. حرك سيد قطب في تفسيره فطرة الإنسان، وأبرز جنوح المسلم عن إدراك المعاني الحقيقية للقرآن وآياته بالحجب التي تقيمها الأهواء والعصبيات والجهل دون تلك الفطرة. ولم يغفل قطب عن استخراج المسائل الفقهية التي حملتها معاني الآيات والآراء الواردة اتفاقاً واختلافاً حولها، ولم تفته اللفتات التربوية عن إبراز النواحي الإعجازية الفنية التي حفلت بها آيات القرآن. لقد شكّل ""في ظلال القرآن"" منعطفاً هاماً في تفسير القرآن، حاك سيد قطب المسلم بلغة معاصرة، بأسلوب يفهمه ويعقله، وبروحية هي أقرب إلى روح العصر الذي غلبت عليه معطيات سياسية، اجتماعية، اقتصادية، إنسانية... عايشها القرآن بآياتها كما عايش روح القرون الماضية، وكما سيعايش القرون القادمة إلى آخر الزمان، واستشفها سيد قطب فجاءت خواطر دوّنها ""في ظلال القرآن"".",4012,125,"2,023 follower","['Religion', 'Islam', 'Reference', 'Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Unfinished', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Islam', 'Reference', 'Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Unfinished', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Islam', 'Reference', 'Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Unfinished', 'Philosophy']",151 review,"2,577 (72%)",562 (15%),240 (6%),68 (1%),107 (3%)

Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War,Paul Fussell,4.17,722 rating,"January 1, 1989","Winner of both the National Book Award for Arts and Letters and the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism, Paul Fussell's The Great War and Modern Memory was one of the most original and gripping volumes ever written about the First World War. Frank Kermode, in The New York Times Book Review, hailed it as ""an important contribution to our understanding of how we came to make World War I part of our minds,"" and Lionel Trilling called it simply ""one of the most deeply moving books I have read in a long time."" In its panoramic scope and poetic intensity, it illuminated a war that changed a generation and revolutionized the way we see the world.Now, in Wartime, Fussell turns to the Second World War, the conflict he himself fought in, to weave a narrative that is both more intensely personal and more wide-ranging. Whereas his former book focused primarily on literary figures, on the image of the Great War in literature, here Fussell examines the immediate impact of the war on common soldiers and civilians. He describes the psychological and emotional atmosphere of World War II. He analyzes the euphemisms people needed to deal with unacceptable reality (the early belief, for instance, that the war could be won by ""precision bombing,"" that is, by long distance); he describes the abnormally intense frustration of desire and some of the means by which desire was satisfied; and, most important, he emphasizes the damage the war did to intellect, discrimination, honesty, individuality, complexity, ambiguity and wit. Of course, no Fussell book would be complete without some serious discussion of the literature of the time. He examines, for instance, how the great privations of wartime (when oranges would be raffled off as valued prizes) resulted in rococo prose styles that dwelt longingly on lavish dinners, and how the ""high-mindedness"" of the era and the almost pathological need to ""accentuate the positive"" led to the downfall of the acerbic H.L. Mencken and the ascent of E.B. White. He also offers astute commentary on Edmund Wilson's argument with Archibald MacLeish, Cyril Connolly's Horizon magazine, the war poetry of Randall Jarrell and Louis Simpson, and many other aspects of the wartime literary world. Fussell conveys the essence of that wartime as no other writer before him. For the past fifty years, the Allied War has been sanitized and romanticized almost beyond recognition by ""the sentimental, the loony patriotic, the ignorant, and the bloodthirsty."" Americans, he says, have never understood what the Second World War was really like. In this stunning volume, he offers such an understanding.",352,57,116 follower,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'War', 'Military History', 'Military Fiction', 'Psychology']",68 review,295 (40%),285 (39%),117 (16%),21 (2%),4 (<1%)
Aelita,Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy,3.57,"1,467 rating","January 1, 1923","Tolstoi published two science fiction novels, both of which appeared in the experimental 1920s and which were revised during the following decades of Stalinist terror. Aelita (1923) is a science-fiction fantasy in the manner of H.G. Wells, telling the story of a Soviet expedition to Mars with the aim of establishing communism. A Red Army officer forments a rebellion of the native Martians, who are in fact long-ago emigrants from Atlantis. The story was adapted into a screen play in 1924. Its futuristic, expressionistic sets were designed by Isaac Rabinovitch of the Kamerny Theatre. The film influenced the design in Flash Gordon, a space opera, which was created by the artist Alex Raymond in 1934 and led to a popular radio serial and several films. Giperboloid inzhenera Garina (1926, The Death Box) described an attempt of an unscrupulous inventor to use his death ray to conquer the world.
