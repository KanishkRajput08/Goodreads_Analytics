Η μητέρα του σκύλου,Pavlos Matesis,4.36,"1,813 rating","January 1, 1990","Μια γυναίκα τιμωρήθηκε. Το αποδέχεται. Και μετατρέπει μόνη της την τιμωρία σε ισόβια: την ""ακινησία"". Μια γυναίκα-""στάσις"". Και γύρω της η βουή και τα πάθη, να τα ριπίζει η τρέλα μεταμφιεσμένη σε αμέριμνο πουλί. Η κόρη της, ως επανάσταση για την τιμωρία, μεταμφιέζει με ψευδώνυμο την πόλη που αδίκησε τη μητέρα της, επιθέτει ψευδώνυμο και στον εαυτό της, βαφτίζεται ""Ραραού"" και καταφεύγουν πρόσφυγες στην πρωτεύουσα. Θύμα, και όχι ηρωίδα του βιβλίου αυτού, η Ραραού εγκαθίσταται στο Μελόδραμα και στο Κωμικό. Την ανάγκασαν να πιστέψει ότι δεν της επιτρέπεται να είναι τραγική, τα πάθη της δεν ανέρχονται σε επίπεδο μεγαλοπρέπειας. Τελικά, όμως, η Τραγωδία, έστω και με σπασμένη κόθορνο, την επισκέπτεται και τη μυρώνει. Γύρω στις δύο γυναίκες, θολή στο βάθος μια χώρα αδέσποτη. Και πρόσωπα πολλά, που πιστεύουν ότι ο κόσμος δημιουργήθηκε ως πρόσχημα για να γίνουν βιβλία τα δικά τους πάθη. Κατά τη διαδρομή του βιβλίου, οι λοιποί κάτοικοί του βαθμιαία ευτυχούν και εγκαταλείπουν ησυχασμένοι και το βιβλίο και τη Ραραού. Η χώρα παραμένει θολή και ακίνητη στο περιθώριο του βιβλίου. Το οποίο βιβλίο δεν αντέχει να παρακολουθήσει τη Ραραού ως το τέλος της: λιποταχτεί, την εγκαταλείπει να συνεχίσει μόνη της. Τελικώς, λάθος μου που την αποκάλεσα θύμα. Αφού άλλωστε μόνη της δηλώνει ευτυχής και επιτυχημένη. Δεν γνωρίζω τι απέγινε η Ραραού.Π.

Birds of America: Stories,Lorrie Moore,4.10,"15,658 rating","January 1, 1998","A long-awaited collection of stories--twelve in all--by one of the most exciting writers at work today, the acclaimed author of Who Will Run the Frog Hospital? and Self-Help. Stories remarkable in their range, emotional force, and dark laughter, and in the sheer beauty and power of their language.From the opening story, ""Willing"", about a second-rate movie actress in her thirties who has moved back to Chicago, where she makes a seedy motel room her home and becomes involved with a mechanic who has not the least idea of who she is as a human being, Birds of America unfolds a startlingly brilliant series of portraits of the unhinged, the lost, the unsettled of our America. In the story ""Which Is More Than I Can Say About Some People"" (""There is nothing as complex in the world--no flower or stone--as a single hello from a human being""), a woman newly separated from her husband is on a long-planned trip through Ireland with her mother. When they set out on an expedition to kiss the Blarney Stone, the image of wisdom and success that her mother has always put forth slips away to reveal the panicky woman she really is. In ""Charades,"" a family game at Christmas is transformed into a hilarious and insightful (and fundamentally upsetting) revelation of crumbling family ties. In ""Community Life,""a shy, almost reclusive, librarian, Transylvania-born and Vermont-bred, moves in with her boyfriend, the local anarchist in a small university town, and all hell breaks loose. And in ""Four Calling Birds, Three French Hens,"" a woman who goes through the stages of grief as she mourns the death of her cat (Anger, Denial, Bargaining, Haagen Dazs, Rage) is seen by her friends as really mourning other issues: the impending death of her parents, the son she never had, Bosnia.In what may be her most stunning book yet, Lorrie Moore explores the personal and the universal, the idiosyncratic and the mundane, with all the wit, brio, and verve that have made her one of the best storytellers of our time.Willing --Which is more than I can say about some people --Dance in America --Community life --Agnes of Iowa --Charades --Four calling birds, three French hens --Beautiful grade --What you want to do fine --Real estate --People like that are the only people here --Terrific mother",308,"['Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'American', 'Literature', 'The United States Of America']","2,292 follower","1,378 review",78,210 (1%),690 (4%),"2,653 (16%)","5,882 (37%)","6,223 (39%)"

Hailed by Time as ""brilliant literary comedy as well as a brilliant sketch of the times,"" A Dance to the Music of Time opens just after World War I. Amid the fever of the 1920s and the first chill of the 1930s, Nick Jenkins and his friends confront sex, society, business, and art. In the second volume they move to London in a whirl of marriage and adulteries, fashions and frivolities, personal triumphs and failures. These books ""provide an unsurpassed picture, at once gay and melancholy, of social and artistic life in Britain between the wars"" (Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.). The third volume follows Nick into army life and evokes London during the blitz. In the climactic final volume, England has won the war and must now count the losses. Four very different young men on the threshold of manhood dominate this opening volume of A Dance to the Music of Time. The narrator, Jenkins—a budding writer—shares a room with Templer, already a passionate womanizer, and Stringham, aristocratic and reckless. Widermerpool, as hopelessly awkward as he is intensely ambitious, lurks on the periphery of their world. Amid the fever of the 1920s and the first chill of the 1930s, these four gain their initiations into sex, society, business, and art.

God Speaks,Meher Baba,4.56,202 rating,"January 1, 1975","God Speaks is Meher Baba's most complete statement of the process of Creation and its purpose. This recent reprinting maintains the contents of the 1973 revised edition while presenting the material in a new style. A contemporary format makes the work attractive and easier to read for today's audiences. God Speaks incorporates all of life into a spiritual saga. The only protagonist is God, and his story encompasses all individual biographies. It is God himself who becomes the three basic processes for the growth and transformation of evolution, reincarnation and involution (the spiritual path of return to Himself). The first phase of God's journey is evolution. It is initiated from a totally unconscious God as if an infinite Ocean were in a state likened to deep sleep. This unconscious God speaks the First Word ""Who am I?"". This question disrupts the limitless, undivided, absolute vacuum, and its reverberations create individualized souls, compared to drops or bubbles within the Ocean. By speaking the First Word, God establishes the process of Creation, in which he assumes evolving forms to gain increasing consciousness. Individuality is the vehicle of this quest. Evolution marks a series of temporary answers to ""Who am I?"" The soul traverses a multitude of forms, beginning with simples gases and proceeding slowly through inanimate stone and mineral forms. These early evolutionary stages obviously have only the most rudimentary consciousness and cannot provide a satisfactory answer to God's original question. The original query thus provides a continuing momentum for the drop soul to develop new forms each with greater consciousness, including the many plant and animal beings. Every evolutionary kingdom reveals new dimensions of consciousness and experience. Each also offers opportunities to gain different kinds of awareness. For example, when the soul identifies itself with varied species of fish, it experiences the world as a creature living in waterconversely, as a bird, it enriches its consciousness by flying through air. When the drop soul finally evolves to human form, consciousness is fully developed, but an individual is still not aware of the potential of his or her consciousness. So the original ""Who am I?"" imperative persists and inaugurates the second reincarnation. Since consciousness is fully developed, there is no longer a need for evolving new forms. The individual's experience, gathered in early stages of evolution, is now humanized and expressed in countless lifetimes. The impulses gained in sub-human forms can play themselves out in the broader context of intelligence, emotions, choices, diverse setting and interactions with people. But obviously no single lifetime can bear the burden of ""humanizing"" the entire evolutionary inheritance randomly or simultaneously. There must be a method for re-experiencing the pre-human legacy in manageable segments. The soul thus experiences alternately a series of opposites, organized according to themes. Accordingly, in different lives, the soul becomes male and female, rich and poor, vigorous and weak, beautiful and ugly. Through exploring the potential of these many opposites, one eventually exhausts all possible human identities and, therefore, has fully learned the entire range of human experience. Here begins the third involution, the process by which the soul returns to the full awareness of the Divine Force, which created him. As Meher Baba puts it, ""When the consciousness of the soul is ripe for disentanglement from the gross world (the everyday world of matter and forms(, it enters the spiritual path and turns inward."" Like evolution, involution has certain states and stages, consisting of ""planes"" and ""realms."" But individuality continues along this spiritual path. In fact, the book quotes the Sufi saying ""There are as many ways to God as there are souls...."" Each new plane denotes a state of being that differs from the states that proceeded it. The first three planes are within the subtle world or domain of energy, ""pran."" There follows the fourth plane, the threshold of the mental world, where misuse of great power for personal desire can lead to disintegration of consciousness. The fifth and sixth planes represent true sainthood, which is understood to be increasing intimacy with God as the Beloved. On the sixth plane, the mind itself becomes the inner eye that sees God everywhere and in everything. ""The loving of God and the longing for His union,"" says Meher Baba ""is fully demonstrated in the sixth plane of consciousness."" The seventh plane marks true and lasting freedom. Impressions go. Duality goes. The drops burst and again become the Ocean. God answers his question of ""Who am I?"" with ""I am God."" The Infinite has returned to the original starting point. He now knows, however, with full consciousness and full awareness that he was, is and always will be infinite. And he realizes that the entire journey has been an illusory dream, the purpose of which is the full awakening of his soul. Yet the saga is not necessarily over. Meher Baba indicates that even among God-realized souls responsibilities within Creation may differ. Most play no further active part in Creation. But a rare few make the journey back to human consciousness. Of these, five become Perfect Masters, blending divine consciousness with awareness of all beings in evolution, reincarnation and involution. These five administer the affairs of the universe. And they use their ""infinite knowledge, power and bliss for the progressive emancipation of all in the field of illusion."" Meher Baba differentiates these Perfect Masters, who are always on earth, from the Avatar, who is the ""that highest status of God, where God directly becomes man and lives on earth as God-man."" He further comments that the ""Avatar is always One and the same, the eternal, indivisible, infinite One who manifests Himself in the form of man as the Avatar, as the Messiah, as the Prophet, as the Buddha, as the Ancient Onethe Highest of the High."" A little over a year before the first publication of God Speaks, Meher Baba officially declared himself to be that Avatara claim that amplifies the meaning of the title. To the one who accepts Meher Baba's position, God's plan is revealed vividly through these pages.",348,"['Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Mysticism', 'India']",67 follower,34 review,148,1 (<1%),8 (3%),16 (7%),29 (14%),148 (73%)

Here, in his newest work, Sparks tells a story about making the greatest commitment of all...loving someone forever. The Rescue When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate. Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone. During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love. In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.",339,"['Romance', 'Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary Romance']",228k follower,"5,016 review",405,"2,134 (1%)","7,425 (3%)","38,963 (19%)","67,642 (33%)","85,310 (42%)"

It shows how the two concepts are related - difference implying divergence and decentering, and repetition implying displacement and disguising.
